{"title": "Improving Factuality and Reasoning in Language Models through Multiagent Debate", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in language generation, understanding, and few-shot learning in recent years. An extensive body of work has explored how their performance may be further improved through the tools of prompting, ranging from verification, self-consistency, or intermediate scratchpads. In this paper, we present a complementary approach to improve language responses where multiple language model instances propose and debate their individual responses and reasoning processes over multiple rounds to arrive at a common final answer. Our findings indicate that this approach significantly enhances mathematical and strategic reasoning across a number of tasks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves the factual validity of generated content, reducing fallacious answers and hallucinations that contemporary models are prone to. Our approach may be directly applied to existing black-box models and uses identical procedure and prompts for all tasks we investigate. Overall, our findings suggest that such \"society of minds\" approach has the potential to significantly advance the capabilities of LLMs and pave the way for further breakthroughs in language generation and understanding."}
{"title": "ODIN: Disentangled Reward Mitigates Hacking in RLHF", "abstract": "In this work, we study the issue of reward hacking on the response length, a challenge emerging in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) on LLMs. A well-formatted, verbose but less helpful response from the LLMs can often deceive LLMs or even human evaluators and achieve high scores. The same issue also holds for some reward models in RL. To address the challenges in both training and evaluation, we establish a more reliable evaluation protocol for comparing different training configurations, which inspects the trade-off between LLM evaluation score and response length obtained by varying training hyperparameters. Based on this evaluation, we conduct large-scale studies, where the results shed insights into the efficacy of hyperparameters and tricks used in RL on mitigating length bias. We further propose to improve the reward model by jointly training two linear heads to predict the preference, one trained to correlate with length and the other trained to decorrelate with length and therefore focusing more on the actual content. We then discard the length head in RL to ignore the spurious length reward. Experiments demonstrate that our approach eliminates the reward correlation with length, and improves the obtained policy by a significant margin."}
{"title": "Agent Instructs Large Language Models to be General Zero-Shot Reasoners", "abstract": "We introduce a method to improve the zero-shot reasoning abilities of large language models on general language understanding tasks. Specifically, we build an autonomous agent to instruct the reasoning process of large language models. To enable this, our agent only needs to generate a single set of instructions for each task. These instructions turn out to be extremely effective for improving the reasoning process of different large language models across all task instances. We show this approach further unleashes the zero-shot reasoning abilities of large language models to more tasks. We study the performance of our method on a wide set of datasets spanning generation, classification, and reasoning. We show that our method generalizes to most tasks and obtains state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on 20 of the 29 datasets that we evaluate. For instance, our method boosts the performance of state-of-the-art large language models by a large margin, including Vicuna-13b, Llama-2-70b-chat, and GPT-3.5 Turbo. Compared to zero-shot chain of thought, our improvement in reasoning is striking. With our method, Llama-2-70b-chat outperforms zero-shot GPT-3.5 Turbo significantly."}

We first utilize large language models (LLMs) to generate the initial layout and introduce a layout-guided 3D Gaussian representation for 3D content generation with adaptive geometric constraints. We then propose an instance-scene compositional optimization mechanism with conditioned diffusion to collaboratively generate realistic 3D scenes with consistent geometry, texture, scale, and accurate interactions among multiple objects while simultaneously adjusting the coarse layout priors extracted from the LLMs to align with the generated scene. Experiments show that GALA3D is a user-friendly, end-to-end framework for state-of-the-art scene-level 3D content generation and controllable editing while ensuring the high fidelity of object-level entities within the scene.

{"title": "Provably Robust DPO: Aligning Language Models with Noisy Feedback", "abstract": "Learning from preference-based feedback has recently gained traction as a promising approach to align language models with human interests. While these aligned generative models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, their dependence on high-quality human preference data poses a bottleneck in practical applications. Specifically, noisy (incorrect and ambiguous) preference pairs in the dataset might restrict the language models from capturing human intent accurately. While practitioners have recently proposed heuristics to mitigate the effect of noisy preferences, a complete theoretical understanding of their workings remain elusive. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a general framework for policy optimization in the presence of random preference flips. We focus on the direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithm in particular since it assumes that preferences adhere to the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, raising concerns about the impact of noisy data on the learned policy. We design a novel loss function, which de-bias the effect of noise on average, making a policy trained by minimizing that loss robust to the noise. Under log-linear parameterization of the policy class and assuming good feature coverage of the SFT policy, we prove that the sub-optimality gap of the proposed robust DPO (rDPO) policy compared to the optimal policy is of the order $O(\\frac{1}{1-2\\epsilon}\\sqrt{\\frac{d}{n}})$, where $\\epsilon < 1/2$ is flip rate of labels, $d$ is policy parameter dimension and $n$ is size of dataset. Our experiments on IMDb sentiment generation and Anthropic's helpful-harmless dataset shows that rDPO is robust to noise in preference labels compared to vanilla DPO and other heuristics proposed by practitioners."}
{"title": "Better Safe than Sorry: Pre-training CLIP against Targeted Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks", "abstract": "Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) on large image-caption datasets has achieved remarkable success in zero-shot classification and enabled transferability to new domains. However, CLIP is extremely more vulnerable to targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks compared to supervised learning. Perhaps surprisingly, poisoning 0.0001% of CLIP pre-training data is enough to make targeted data poisoning attacks successful. This is four orders of magnitude smaller than what is required to poison supervised models. Despite this vulnerability, existing methods are very limited in defending CLIP models during pre-training. In this work, we propose a strong defense, SAFECLIP, to safely pre-train CLIP against targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks. SAFECLIP warms up the model by applying unimodal contrastive learning (CL) on image and text modalities separately. Then, it divides the data into safe and risky sets by applying a Gaussian Mixture Model to the cosine similarity of image-caption pair representations. SAFECLIP pre-trains the model by applying the CLIP loss to the safe set and applying unimodal CL to image and text modalities of the risky set separately. By gradually increasing the size of the safe set during pre-training, SAFECLIP effectively breaks targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks without harming the CLIP performance. Our extensive experiments on CC3M, Visual Genome, and MSCOCO demonstrate that SAFECLIP significantly reduces the success rate of targeted data poisoning attacks from 93.75% to 0% and that of various backdoor attacks from up to 100% to 0%, without harming CLIP’s performance."}
{"title": "COLD-Attack: Jailbreaking LLMs with Stealthiness and Controllability", "abstract": "Jailbreaks on large language models (LLMs) have recently received increasing attention. For a comprehensive assessment of LLM safety, it is essential to consider jailbreaks with diverse attributes, such as contextual coherence and sentiment/stylistic variations, and hence it is beneficial to study controllable jailbreaking, i.e. how to enforce control on LLM attacks. In this paper, we formally formulate the controllable attack generation problem, and build a novel connection between this problem and controllable text generation, a well-explored topic of natural language processing. Based on this connection, we adapt the Energy-based Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics (COLD), a state-of-the-art, highly efficient algorithm in controllable text generation, and introduce the COLD-Attack framework which unifies and automates the search of adversarial LLM attacks under a variety of control requirements such as fluency, stealthiness, sentiment, and left-right-coherence. The controllability enabled by COLD-Attack leads to diverse new jailbreak scenarios which not only cover the standard setting of generating fluent (suffix) attack with continuation constraint, but also allow us to address new controllable attack settings such as revising a user query adversarially with paraphrasing constraint, and inserting stealthy attacks in context with position constraint. Our extensive experiments on various LLMs (Llama-2, Mistral, Vicuna, Guanaco, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) show COLD-Attack's broad applicability, strong controllability, high success rate, and attack transferability.

{"title": "Actions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations", "abstract": "Large-scale recommendation systems are characterized by their reliance on high cardinality, heterogeneous features and the need to handle tens of billions of user actions on a daily basis. Despite being trained on huge volume of data with thousands of features, most Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) in industry fail to scale with compute. Inspired by success achieved by Transformers in language and vision domains, we revisit fundamental design choices in recommendation systems. We reformulate recommendation problems as sequential transduction tasks within a generative modeling framework (``Generative Recommenders''), and propose a new architecture, HSTU, designed for high cardinality, non-stationary streaming recommendation data. HSTU outperforms baselines over synthetic and public datasets by up to 65.8% in NDCG, and is 5.3x to 15.2x faster than FlashAttention2-based Transformers on 8192 length sequences. HSTU-based Generative Recommenders, with 1.5 trillion parameters, improve metrics in online A/B tests by 12.4% and have been deployed on multiple surfaces of a large internet platform with billions of users. More importantly, the model quality of Generative Recommenders empirically scales as a power-law of training compute across three orders of magnitude, up to GPT-3/LLaMa-2 scale, which reduces carbon footprint needed for future model developments, and further paves the way for the first foundation models in recommendations."}
{"title": "Exploring Intrinsic Dimension for Vision-Language Model Pruning", "abstract": "The intrinsic dimension (ID) represents the minimum dimension needed to describe data on a lower-dimensional manifold within high-dimensional spaces. Network pruning aims to reduce the complexity of high-dimensional networks while minimizing performance trade-offs. This symmetry motivates the exploration of ID as a metric for effective pruning. For vision-language models, we investigate whether different modalities exist on separate manifolds, indicating varying complexity and prunability. We empirically study ID variations in large-scale vision-language pre-trained models and examine the contributions of different modalities to model prunability. We propose a layer importance metric based on ID, which can conveniently integrate with current metrics and enhance performance in vision-language model pruning. The experimental results show a high correlation between ID and modality prunability. Visual representations are more sensitive and crucial to model performance, while language representations are more robust and offer greater prunability. Our findings suggest an asymmetric pruning strategy for vision and language modalities, guided by the ID metric. The code is available at https://github.com/Nofear18/ID_VL_Pruning"}
{"title": "Evaluating and Analyzing Relationship Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models", "abstract": "The issue of hallucinations is a prevalent concern in existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Previous efforts have primarily focused on investigating object hallucinations, which can be easily alleviated by introducing object detectors. However, these efforts neglect hallucinations in inter-object relationships, which is essential for visual comprehension. In this work, we introduce R-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating Vision Relationship Hallucination. R-Bench features image-level questions that focus on the existence of relationships and instance-level questions that assess local visual comprehension. We identify three types of relationship co-occurrences that lead to hallucinations: relationship-relationship, subject-relationship, and relationship-object. The visual instruction tuning dataset's long-tail distribution significantly impacts LVLMs' understanding of visual relationships. Additionally, our analysis reveals that current LVLMs tend to overlook visual content, overly rely on the common sense knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs), and struggle with spatial relationship reasoning based on contextual information."}
{"title": "The WMDP Benchmark: Measuring and Reducing Malicious Use with Unlearning", "abstract": "The White House Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence highlights the risks of large language models (LLMs) empowering malicious actors in developing biological, cyber, and chemical weapons. To measure these risks, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private and restricted to a narrow range of malicious use scenarios, which limits further research into reducing malicious use. To fill these gaps, we release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 3,668 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations. RMU reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities in areas such as biology and computer science, suggesting that unlearning may be a concrete path towards reducing malicious use from LLMs. We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://wmdp.ai."}
{"title": "CHAI: Clustered Head Attention for Efficient LLM Inference", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters have transformed the field of machine learning. However, serving these models at inference time is both compute and memory intensive, where a single request can require multiple GPUs and tens of Gigabytes of memory. Multi-head attention is one of the key components of LLMs, which can for over 50% of LLMs memory and compute requirement. We observe that there is a high amount of redundancy across heads on which tokens they pay attention to. Based on this insight, we propose Clustered HeadAttention ( CHAI ). CHAI combines heads with a high amount of correlation for self-attention at runtime, thus reducing both memory and compute. In our experiments, we show that CHAI is able to reduce the memory requirements for storing K,V cache by up to 21.4% and inference time latency by up to 1.73× without any fine-tuning required. CHAI achieves this with a maximum 3.2% deviation in accuracy across 3 different models (i.e. OPT-66B, LLAMA-7B, LLAMA-33B) and 5 different evaluation datasets."}
{"title": "Envisioning Outlier Exposure by Large Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Detection", "abstract": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential when deploying machine learning models in open-world scenarios. Zero-shot OOD detection, requiring no training on in-distribution (ID) data, has been possible with the advent of vision-language models like CLIP. Existing methods build a text-based classifier with only closed-set labels. However, this largely restricts the inherent capability of CLIP to recognize samples from large and open label space. In this paper, we propose to tackle this constraint by leveraging the expert knowledge and reasoning capability of large language models (LLM) to Envision potential Outlier Exposure, termed EOE, without access to any actual OOD data. Owing to better adaptation to open-world scenarios, EOE can be generalized to different tasks, including far, near, and fine-grained OOD detection. Technically, we design (1) LLM prompts based on visual similarity to generate potential outlier class labels specialized for OOD detection, as well as (2) a new score function based on potential outlier penalty to distinguish hard OOD samples effectively. Empirically, EOE achieves state-of-the-art performance across different OOD tasks and can be effectively scaled to the ImageNet-1K dataset.

{"title": "A Dense Reward View on Aligning Text-to-Image Diffusion with Preference", "abstract": "Aligning text-to-image diffusion model (T2I) with preference has been gaining increasing research attention. While prior works exist on directly optimizing T2I by preference data, these methods are developed under the bandit assumption of a latent reward on the entire diffusion reverse chain, while ignoring the sequential nature of the generation process. This may harm the efficacy and efficiency of preference alignment. In this paper, we take on a finer dense reward perspective and derive a tractable alignment objective that emphasizes the initial steps of the T2I reverse chain. In particular, we introduce temporal discounting into DPO-style explicit-reward-free objectives, to break the temporal symmetry therein and suit the T2I generation hierarchy. In experiments on single and multiple prompt generation, our method is competitive with strong relevant baselines, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Further investigations are conducted to illustrate the insight of our approach. Source code is available at https://github.com/Shentao-YANG/Dense_Reward_T2I ."}
{"title": "Do Efficient Transformers Really Save Computation?", "abstract": "As transformer-based language models are trained on increasingly large datasets and with vast numbers of parameters, finding more efficient alternatives to the standard Transformer has become very valuable. While many efficient Transformers and Transformer alternatives have been proposed, none provide theoretical guarantees that they are a suitable replacement for the standard Transformer. This makes it challenging to identify when to use a specific model and what directions to prioritize for further investigation. In this paper, we aim to understand the capabilities and limitations of efficient Transformers, specifically the Sparse Transformer and the Linear Transformer. We focus on their reasoning capability as exhibited by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts and follow previous works to model them as Dynamic Programming (DP) problems. Our results show that while these models are expressive enough to solve general DP tasks, contrary to expectations, they require a model size that scales with the problem size. Nonetheless, we identify a class of DP problems for which these models can be more efficient than the standard Transformer. We confirm our theoretical results through experiments on representative DP tasks, adding to the understanding of efficient Transformers' practical strengths and weaknesses."}
{"title": "LLM-Empowered State Representation for Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Conventional state representations in reinforcement learning often omit critical task-related details, presenting a significant challenge for value networks in establishing accurate mappings from states to task rewards. Traditional methods typically depend on extensive sample learning to enrich state representations with task-specific information, which leads to low sample efficiency and high time costs. Recently, surging knowledgeable large language models (LLM) have provided promising substitutes for prior injection with minimal human intervention. Motivated by this, we propose LLM-Empowered State Representation (LESR), a novel approach that utilizes LLM to autonomously generate task-related state representation codes which help to enhance the continuity of network mappings and facilitate efficient training. Experimental results demonstrate LESR exhibits high sample efficiency and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of **29%** in accumulated reward in Mujoco tasks and **30%** in success rates in Gym-Robotics tasks.

In this work, we tackle the problem of training a robot to understand multimodal prompts, interleaving vision signals with text descriptions. This type of task poses a major challenge to robots' capability to understand the interconnection and complementarity between vision and language signals. In this work, we introduce an effective framework that learns a policy to perform robot manipulation with multimodal prompts from multi-task expert trajectories. Our methods consist of a two-stage training pipeline that performs inverse dynamics pretraining and multi-task finetuning. To facilitate multimodal understanding, we design our multimodal prompt encoder by augmenting a pretrained LM with a residual connection to the visual input and model the dependencies among action dimensions. Empirically, we evaluate the efficacy of our method on the VIMA-BENCH and establish a new state-of-the-art (10% improvement in success rate). Moreover, we demonstrate that our model exhibits remarkable in-context learning ability."}

Built upon Megatron-LM, EE-LLM implements a variety of algorithmic innovations and performance optimizations tailored to early exiting, including a lightweight method that facilitates backpropagation for the early-exit training objective with pipeline parallelism, techniques of leveraging idle resources in the original pipeline schedule for computation related to early-exit layers, and two approaches of early-exit inference that are compatible with KV caching for autoregressive generation. Our analytical and empirical study shows that EE-LLM achieves great training efficiency with negligible computational overhead compared to standard LLM training, as well as outstanding inference speedup without compromising output quality.

While recent generative AI models, such as large language models, have shown impressive performance in various tasks, it remains unclear whether they truly comprehend emotions and why. This paper aims to address this gap by incorporating psychological theories to gain a holistic understanding of emotions in generative AI models. Specifically, we propose three approaches: 1) EmotionPrompt to enhance AI model performance, 2) EmotionAttack to impair AI model performance, and 3) EmotionDecode to explain the effects of emotional stimuli, both benign and malignant. Through extensive experiments involving language and multi-modal models on semantic understanding, logical reasoning, and generation tasks, we demonstrate that both textual and visual EmotionPrompt can boost the performance of AI models while EmotionAttack can hinder it. More importantly, EmotionDecode reveals that AI models can comprehend emotional stimuli akin to the mechanism of dopamine in the human brain. Our work heralds a novel avenue for exploring psychology to enhance our understanding of generative AI models, thus boosting the research and development of human-AI collaboration and mitigating potential risks."}

Then, we implement a practical competitive environment using GPT-4 to simulate a virtual town with two types of agents, including restaurant agents and customer agents. Specifically, the restaurant agents compete with each other to attract more customers, where competition encourages them to transform, such as cultivating new operating strategies. Simulation experiments reveal several interesting findings at the micro and macro levels, which align well with existing market and sociological theories.

{"title": "Fast Adversarial Attacks on Language Models In One GPU Minute", "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel class of fast, beam search-based adversarial attack (BEAST) for Language Models (LMs). BEAST employs interpretable parameters, enabling attackers to balance between attack speed, success rate, and the readability of adversarial prompts. The computational efficiency of BEAST facilitates us to investigate its applications on LMs for jailbreaking, eliciting hallucinations, and privacy attacks. Our gradient-free targeted attack can jailbreak aligned LMs with high attack success rates within one minute. For instance, BEAST can jailbreak Vicuna-7B-v1.5 under one minute with a success rate of 89% when compared to a gradient-based baseline that takes over an hour to achieve 70% success rate using a single Nvidia RTX A6000 48GB GPU. BEAST can also generate adversarial suffixes for successful jailbreaks that can transfer to unseen prompts and unseen models such as GPT-4-Turbo. Additionally, we discover a unique outcome wherein our untargeted attack induces hallucinations in LM chatbots. Through human evaluations, we find that our untargeted attack causes Vicuna-7B-v1.5 to produce $\\sim$15% more incorrect outputs when compared to LM outputs in the absence of our attack. We also learn that 22% of the time, BEAST causes Vicuna to generate outputs that are not relevant to the original prompt. Further, we use BEAST to generate adversarial prompts in a few seconds that can boost the performance of existing membership inference attacks for LMs. We believe that our fast attack, BEAST, has the potential to accelerate research in LM security and privacy."}
{"title": "Position: Social Choice Should Guide AI Alignment in Dealing with Diverse Human Feedback", "abstract": "Foundation models such as GPT-4 are fine-tuned to avoid unsafe or otherwise problematic behavior, such as helping to commit crimes or producing racist text. One approach to fine-tuning, called reinforcement learning from human feedback, learns from humans’ expressed preferences over multiple outputs.

How can we aggregate the input into consistent data about “collective” preferences or otherwise use it to make collective choices about model behavior?

{"title": "One for All: A Universal Generator for Concept Unlearnability via Multi-Modal Alignment", "abstract": "The abundance of free internet data offers unprecedented opportunities for researchers and developers, but it also poses privacy risks. Utilizing data without explicit consent raises critical challenges in protecting personal information.Unlearnable examples have emerged as a feasible protection approach, which renders the data unlearnable, i.e., useless to third parties, by injecting imperceptible perturbations. However, these perturbations only exhibit unlearnable effects on either a particular dataset or label-consistent scenarios, thereby lacking broad applicability. To address both issues concurrently, we propose a universal perturbation generator that harnesses data with concept unlearnability, thereby broadening the scope of unlearnability beyond specific datasets or labels. Specifically, we leverage multi-modal pre-trained models to establish a connection between the data concepts in a shared embedding space. This connection enables the information transformation from image data to text concepts. Consequently, we can align the text embedding using concept-wise discriminant loss, and render the data unlearnable. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the concept unlearnability, i.e., cross-dataset transferability and label-agnostic utility, of our proposed unlearnable examples, as well as their robustness against attacks."}
{"title": "Chain of Code: Reasoning with a Language Model-Augmented Code Emulator", "abstract": "Code provides a general syntactic structure to build complex programs and perform precise computations when paired with a code interpreter – we hypothesize that language models (LMs) can leverage code-writing to improve Chain of Thought reasoning not only for logic and arithmetic tasks, but also for semantic ones (and in particular, those that are a mix of both). For example, consider prompting an LM to write code that counts the number of times it detects sarcasm in an essay: the LM may struggle to write an implementation for \"detect_sarcasm(string)\" that can be executed by the interpreter (handling the edge cases would be insurmountable). However, LMs may still produce a valid solution if they not only write code, but also selectively \"emulate\" the interpreter by generating the expected output of \"detect_sarcasm(string)\". In this work, we propose Chain of Code (CoC), a simple yet surprisingly effective extension that improves LM code-driven reasoning. The key idea is to encourage LMs to format semantic sub-tasks in a program as flexible pseudocode that the interpreter can explicitly catch undefined behaviors and hand off to simulate with an LM (as an \"LMulator\"). Experiments demonstrate that Chain of Code outperforms Chain of Thought and other baselines across a variety of benchmarks; on BIG-Bench Hard, Chain of Code achieves 84%, a gain of 12% over Chain of Thought. In a nutshell, CoC broadens the scope of reasoning questions that LMs can answer by \"thinking in code\"."}

RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF), introduced in Bai et al. (2022b), offers a promising alternative that trains the reward model (RM) on preferences generated by an off-the-shelf LLM. Across the tasks of summarization, helpful dialogue generation, and harmless dialogue generation, we show that RLAIF achieves comparable performance to RLHF. Furthermore, we take a step towards \"self-improvement\" by demonstrating that RLAIF can outperform a supervised fine-tuned baseline even when the AI labeler is the same size as the policy, or even the exact same checkpoint as the initial policy. Finally, we introduce direct-RLAIF (d-RLAIF) - a technique that circumvents RM training by obtaining rewards directly from an off-the-shelf LLM during RL, which achieves superior performance to canonical RLAIF. Our results suggest that RLAIF can achieve performance on-par with using human feedback, offering a potential solution to the scalability limitations of RLHF."}
{"title": "Language Agents with Reinforcement Learning for Strategic Play in the Werewolf Game", "abstract": "Agents built with large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential across a wide range of domains. However, in complex decision-making tasks, pure LLM-based agents tend to exhibit intrinsic bias in their choice of actions, which is inherited from the model's training data and results in suboptimal performance. To develop *strategic language agents*, i.e., agents that generate flexible language actions and possess strong decision-making abilities, we propose a novel framework that powers LLM-based agents with reinforcement learning (RL). We consider Werewolf, a popular social deduction game, as a challenging testbed that emphasizes versatile communication and strategic gameplay. To mitigate the intrinsic bias in language actions, our agents use an LLM to perform deductive reasoning and generate a diverse set of action candidates. Then an RL policy trained to optimize the decision-making ability chooses an action from the candidates to play in the game. Extensive experiments show that our agents overcome the intrinsic bias and outperform existing LLM-based agents in the Werewolf game. We also conduct human-agent experiments and find that our agents achieve human-level performance and demonstrate strong strategic play."}
{"title": "Get More with LESS: Synthesizing Recurrence with KV Cache Compression for Efficient LLM Inference", "abstract": "Many computational factors limit broader deployment of large language models. In this paper, we focus on a memory bottleneck imposed by the key-value (KV) cache, a computational shortcut that requires storing previous KV pairs during decoding. While existing KV cache methods approach this problem by pruning or evicting large swaths of relatively less important KV pairs to dramatically reduce the memory footprint of the cache, they can have limited success in tasks that require recollecting a majority of previous tokens. To alleviate this issue, we propose LESS, a simple integration of a (nearly free) constant sized cache with eviction-based cache methods, such that all tokens can be queried at later decoding steps. Its ability to retain information throughout time shows merit on a variety of tasks where we demonstrate LESS can help reduce the performance gap from caching everything, sometimes even matching it, all while being efficient.

{"title": "On Prompt-Driven Safeguarding for Large Language Models", "abstract": "Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a \"higher-refusal\" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance."}
{"title": "Distinguishing the Knowable from the Unknowable with Language Models", "abstract": "We study the feasibility of identifying *epistemic* uncertainty (reflecting a lack of knowledge), as opposed to *aleatoric* uncertainty (reflecting entropy in the underlying distribution), in the outputs of large language models (LLMs) over free-form text. In the absence of ground-truth probabilities, we explore a setting where, in order to (approximately) disentangle a given LLM's uncertainty, a significantly larger model stands in as a proxy for the ground truth. We show that small linear probes trained on the embeddings of frozen, pretrained models accurately predict when larger models will be more confident at the token level and that probes trained on one text domain generalize to others. Going further, we propose a fully unsupervised method that achieves non-trivial accuracy on the same task. Taken together, we interpret these results as evidence that LLMs naturally contain internal representations of different types of uncertainty that could potentially be leveraged to devise more informative indicators of model confidence in diverse practical settings.

{"title": "Language Models with Conformal Factuality Guarantees", "abstract": "Guaranteeing the correctness and factuality of language model (LM) outputs is a major open problem. In this work, we propose conformal factuality, a framework that can ensure high probability correctness guarantees for LMs by connecting language modeling and conformal prediction. Our insight is that the correctness of an LM output is equivalent to an uncertainty quantification problem, where the uncertainty sets are defined as the entailment set of an LM's output. Using this connection, we show that conformal prediction in language models corresponds to a back-off algorithm that provides high probability correctness guarantees by progressively making LM outputs less specific (and expanding the associated uncertainty sets). This approach applies to any black-box LM and requires very few human-annotated samples. Evaluations of our approach on closed book QA (FActScore, NaturalQuestions) and reasoning tasks (MATH) show that our approach can provide 80-90% correctness guarantees while retaining the majority of the LM's original output."}

We unify these approaches by describing LLM-based agents as computational graphs. The nodes implement functions to process multimodal data or query LLMs, and the edges describe the information flow between operations. Graphs can be recursively combined into larger composite graphs representing hierarchies of inter-agent collaboration (where edges connect operations of different agents). Our novel automatic graph optimizers (1) refine node-level LLM prompts (node optimization) and (2) improve agent orchestration by changing graph connectivity (edge optimization).

{"title": "An LLM Compiler for Parallel Function Calling", "abstract": "The reasoning capabilities of the recent LLMs enable them to execute external function calls to overcome their inherent limitations, such as knowledge cutoffs, poor arithmetic skills, or lack of access to private data. This development has allowed LLMs to select and coordinate multiple functions based on the context to tackle more complex problems. However, current methods for function calling often require sequential reasoning and acting for each function which can result in high latency, cost, and sometimes inaccurate behavior. To address this, we introduce LLMCompiler, which executes functions in parallel to efficiently orchestrate multiple function calls. Drawing inspiration from the principles of classical compilers, LLMCompiler enables parallel function calling with three components: (i) a Function Calling Planner, formulating execution plans for function calling; (ii) a Task Fetching Unit, dispatching function calling tasks; and (iii) an Executor, executing these tasks in parallel. LLMCompiler automatically generates an optimized orchestration for the function calls and can be used with both open-source and closed-source models. We have benchmarked LLMCompiler on a range of tasks with different patterns of function calling. We observe consistent latency speedup of up to $3.7 \\times$, cost savings of up to $6.7 \\times$, and accuracy improvement of up to $\\sim 9 \\%$ compared to ReAct.Our code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/LLMCompiler."}
{"title": "Compressible Dynamics in Deep Overparameterized Low-Rank Learning & Adaptation", "abstract": "While overparameterization in machine learning models offers great benefits in terms of optimization and generalization, it also leads to increased computational requirements as model sizes grow. In this work, we show that by leveraging the inherent low-dimensional structures of data and compressible dynamics within the model parameters, we can reap the benefits of overparameterization without the computational burdens. In practice, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for deep low-rank matrix completion as well as fine-tuning language models. Our approach is grounded in theoretical findings for deep overparameterized low-rank matrix recovery, where we show that the learning dynamics of each weight matrix are confined to an invariant low-dimensional subspace. Consequently, we can construct and train compact, highly compressed factorizations possessing the same benefits as their overparameterized counterparts. In the context of deep matrix completion, our technique substantially improves training efficiency while retaining the advantages of overparameterization. For language model fine-tuning, we propose a method called \"Deep LoRA\", which improves the existing low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique, leading to reduced overfitting and a simplified hyperparameter setup, while maintaining comparable efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of Deep LoRA on natural language tasks, particularly when fine-tuning with limited data."}

{"title": "Any-Precision LLM: Low-Cost Deployment of Multiple, Different-Sized LLMs", "abstract": "Recently, considerable efforts have been directed towards compressing Large Language Models (LLMs), which showcase groundbreaking capabilities across diverse applications but entail significant deployment costs due to their large sizes. Meanwhile, much less attention has been given to mitigating the costs associated with deploying multiple LLMs of varying sizes despite its practical significance. Thus, this paper introduces any-precision LLM, extending the concept of any-precision DNN to LLMs. Addressing challenges in any-precision LLM, we propose a lightweight method for any-precision quantization of LLMs, leveraging a post-training quantization framework, and develop a specialized software engine for its efficient serving. As a result, our solution significantly reduces the high costs of deploying multiple, different-sized LLMs by overlaying LLMs quantized to varying bit-widths, such as 3, 4, ..., $n$ bits, into a memory footprint comparable to a single $n$-bit LLM. All the supported LLMs with varying bit-widths demonstrate state-of-the-art model quality and inference throughput, proving itself to be a compelling option for deployment of multiple, different-sized LLMs."}
{"title": "Asymmetry in Low-Rank Adapters of Foundation Models", "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning optimizes large, pre-trained foundation models by updating a subset of parameters; in this class, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is particularly effective. Inspired by an effort to investigate the different roles of LoRA matrices during fine-tuning, this paper characterizes and leverages unexpected asymmetry in the importance of low-rank adapter matrices. Specifically, when updating the parameter matrices of a neural network by adding a product $BA$, we observe that the $B$ and $A$ matrices have distinct functions: $A$ extracts features from the input, while $B$ uses these features to create the desired output. Based on this observation, we demonstrate that fine-tuning $B$ is inherently more effective than fine-tuning $A$, and that a random untrained $A$ should perform nearly as well as a fine-tuned one. Using an information-theoretic lens, we also bound the generalization of low-rank adapters, showing that the parameter savings of exclusively training $B$ improves the bound. We support our conclusions with experiments on RoBERTa, BART-Large, LLaMA-2, and ViTs. The code and data is available at https://github.com/Jiacheng-Zhu-AIML/AsymmetryLoRA"}
{"title": "Faithfulness Measurable Masked Language Models", "abstract": "A common approach to explaining NLP models is to use importance measures that express which tokens are important for a prediction. Unfortunately, such explanations are often wrong despite being persuasive. Therefore, it is essential to measure their faithfulness. One such metric is if tokens are truly important, then masking them should result in worse model performance. However, token masking introduces out-of-distribution issues, and existing solutions that address this are computationally expensive and employ proxy models. Furthermore, other metrics are very limited in scope. This work proposes an inherently faithfulness measurable model that addresses these challenges. This is achieved using a novel fine-tuning method that incorporates masking, such that masking tokens become in-distribution by design. This differs from existing approaches, which are completely model-agnostic but are inapplicable in practice. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by applying it to 16 different datasets and validate it using statistical in-distribution tests. The faithfulness is then measured with 9 different importance measures. Because masking is in-distribution, importance measures that themselves use masking become consistently more faithful. Additionally, because the model makes faithfulness cheap to measure, we can optimize explanations towards maximal faithfulness; thus, our model becomes indirectly inherently explainable."}
{"title": "Keypoint-based Progressive Chain-of-Thought Distillation for LLMs", "abstract": "Chain-of-thought distillation is a powerful technique for transferring reasoning abilities from large language models (LLMs) to smaller student models. Previous methods typically require the student to mimic the step-by-step rationale produced by LLMs, often facing the following challenges: (i) Tokens within a rationale vary in significance, and treating them equally may fail to accurately mimic keypoint tokens, leading to reasoning errors. (ii) They usually distill knowledge by consistently predicting all the steps in a rationale, which falls short in distinguishing the learning order of step generation. This diverges from the human cognitive progression of starting with easy tasks and advancing to harder ones, resulting in sub-optimal outcomes. To this end, we propose a unified framework, called KPOD, to address these issues. Specifically, we propose a token weighting module utilizing mask learning to encourage accurate mimicry of keypoint tokens by the student during distillation. Besides, we develop an in-rationale progressive distillation strategy, starting with training the student to generate the final reasoning steps and gradually extending to cover the entire rationale. To accomplish this, a weighted token generation loss is proposed to assess step reasoning difficulty, and a value function is devised to schedule the progressive distillation by considering both step difficulty and question diversity. Extensive experiments on four reasoning benchmarks illustrate our KPOD outperforms previous methods by a large margin."}
{"title": "PARDEN, Can You Repeat That? Defending against Jailbreaks via Repetition", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown success in many natural language processing tasks. Despite rigorous safety alignment processes, supposedly safety-aligned LLMs like Llama 2 and Claude 2 are still susceptible to jailbreaks, leading to security risks and abuse of the models. One option to mitigate such risks is to augment the LLM with a dedicated \"safeguard\", which checks the LLM's inputs or outputs for undesired behaviour. A promising approach is to use the LLM itself as the safeguard. Nonetheless, baseline methods, such as prompting the LLM to self-classify toxic content, demonstrate limited efficacy. We hypothesise that this is due to domain shift: the alignment training imparts a self-censoring behaviour to the model (\"Sorry I can't do that\"), while the self-classify approach shifts it to a classification format (\"Is this prompt malicious\"). In this work, we propose PARDEN, which avoids this domain shift by simply asking the model to repeat its own outputs. PARDEN neither requires finetuning nor white box access to the model. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our method and show that PARDEN significantly outperforms existing jailbreak detection baselines for Llama-2 and Claude-2. We find that PARDEN is particularly powerful in the relevant regime of high True Positive Rate (TPR) and low False Positive Rate (FPR). For instance, for Llama2-7B, at TPR equal to 90%, PARDEN accomplishes a roughly 11x reduction in the FPR from 24.8% to 2.0% on the harmful behaviours dataset.

{"title": "A Touch, Vision, and Language Dataset for Multimodal Alignment", "abstract": "Touch is an important sensing modality for humans, but it has not yet been incorporated into a multimodal generative language model. This is partially due to the difficulty of obtaining natural language labels for tactile data and the complexity of aligning tactile readings with both visual observations and language descriptions. As a step towards bridging that gap, this work introduces a new dataset of 44K in-the-wild visiontouch pairs, with English language labels annotated by humans (10%) and textual pseudo-labels from GPT-4V (90%). We use this dataset to train a vision-language-aligned tactile encoder for open-vocabulary classification and a touch-visionlanguage (TVL) model for text generation using the trained encoder. Results suggest that by incorporating touch, the TVL model improves (+29% classification accuracy) tactile-vision-language alignment over existing models trained on any pair of those modalities. Although only a small fraction of the dataset is human labeled, the TVL model demonstrates improved visual-tactile understanding over GPT-4V (+12%) and open-source vision-language models (+32%) on a new touch-vision understanding benchmark.

{"title": "Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference", "abstract": "Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key–value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for on-line key–value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to $\\sim 3.7 \\times$ throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. We find that DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4$\\times$ cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key–value eviction policies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. As a result DMC fits longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.

The core challenge in applying RL to complex reasoning is to identify a sequence of actions that result in positive rewards and provide appropriate supervision for optimization. Outcome supervision provides sparse rewards for final results without identifying error locations, whereas process supervision offers step-wise rewards but requires extensive manual annotation. **R**$^3$ overcomes these limitations by learning from correct demonstrations. Specifically, **R**$^3$ progressively slides the start state of reasoning from a demonstration's end to its beginning, facilitating easier model exploration at all stages. Thus, **R**$^3$ establishes a step-wise curriculum, allowing outcome supervision to offer step-level signals and precisely pinpoint errors. Using Llama2-7B, our method surpasses RL baseline on eight reasoning tasks by $4.1$ points on average. Notably, in program-based reasoning, 7B-scale models perform comparably to larger models or closed-source models with our **R**$^3$."}
{"title": "Accelerated Speculative Sampling Based on Tree Monte Carlo", "abstract": "Speculative Sampling (SpS) has been introduced to speed up inference of large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple tokens in a single forward pass under the guidance of a reference model, while preserving the original distribution. We observe that SpS can be derived through maximum coupling on the token distribution. However, we find that this approach is not optimal as it applies maximum coupling incrementally for each new token, rather than seeking a global maximum coupling that yields a faster algorithm, given the tree-space nature of LLM generative distributions. In this paper, we shift our focus from distributions on a token space to those on a tree space. We propose a novel class of Tree Monte Carlo (TMC) methods, demonstrating their unbiasedness and convergence. As a particular instance of TMC, our new algorithm, Accelerated Speculative Sampling (ASpS), outperforms traditional SpS by generating more tokens per step on average, achieving faster inference, while maintaining the original distribution."}
{"title": "APT: Adaptive Pruning and Tuning Pretrained Language Models for Efficient Training and Inference", "abstract": "Fine-tuning and inference with large Language Models (LM) are generally known to be expensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning over pretrained LMs reduces training memory by updating a small number of LM parameters but does not improve inference efficiency. Structured pruning improves LM inference efficiency by removing consistent parameter blocks, yet often increases training memory and time. To improve both training and inference efficiency, we introduce APT that adaptively *prunes* and *tunes* parameters for the LMs. At the early stage of fine-tuning, APT dynamically adds *salient* tuning parameters for fast and accurate convergence while discarding unimportant parameters for efficiency. Compared to baselines, our experiments show that APT maintains up to 98% task performance when pruning RoBERTa and T5 models with 40% parameters left while keeping 86.4% LLaMA models' performance with 70% parameters remaining.

{"title": "Language Models as Semantic Indexers", "abstract": "Semantic identifier (ID) is an important concept in information retrieval that aims to preserve the semantics of objects such as documents and items inside their IDs. Previous studies typically adopt a two-stage pipeline to learn semantic IDs by first procuring embeddings using off-the-shelf text encoders and then deriving IDs based on the embeddings. However, each step introduces potential information loss, and there is usually an inherent mismatch between the distribution of embeddings within the latent space produced by text encoders and the anticipated distribution required for semantic indexing. It is non-trivial to design a method that can learn the document’s semantic representations and its hierarchical structure simultaneously, given that semantic IDs are discrete and sequentially structured, and the semantic supervision is deficient. In this paper, we introduce LMIndexer, a self-supervised framework to learn semantic IDs with a generative language model. We tackle the challenge of sequential discrete ID by introducing a semantic indexer capable of generating neural sequential discrete representations with progressive training and contrastive learning. In response to the semantic supervision deficiency, we propose to train the model with a self-supervised document reconstruction objective. We show the high quality of the learned IDs and demonstrate their effectiveness on three tasks including recommendation, product search, and document retrieval on five datasets from various domains.

As the impact of these foundation models grows, understanding and evaluating their biases becomes crucial to achieving fairness and accuracy. We propose to study what LLMs know about the world we live in through the lens of geography. This approach is particularly powerful as there is ground truth for the numerous aspects of human life that are meaningfully projected onto geographic space such as culture, race, language, politics, and religion. We show various problematic geographic biases, which we define as systemic errors in geospatial predictions. Initially, we demonstrate that LLMs are capable of making accurate zero-shot geospatial predictions in the form of ratings that show strong monotonic correlation with ground truth (Spearman's $\\rho$ of up to 0.89). We then show that LLMs exhibit common biases across a range of objective and subjective topics. In particular, LLMs are clearly biased against locations with lower socioeconomic conditions (e.g. most of Africa) on a variety of sensitive subjective topics such as attractiveness, morality, and intelligence (Spearman’s $\\rho$ of up to 0.70). Finally, we introduce a bias score to quantify this and find that there is significant variation in the magnitude of bias across existing LLMs. Code is available on the project website: https://rohinmanvi.github.io/GeoLLM."}

Recent approaches typically employ supervised fine-tuning methods to adapt CLIP for zero-shot multi-label image recognition tasks. However, obtaining sufficient multi-label annotated image data for training is challenging and not scalable. In this paper, we propose a new language-driven framework for zero-shot multi-label recognition that eliminates the need for annotated images during training. Leveraging the aligned CLIP multi-modal embedding space, our method utilizes language data generated by LLMs to train a cross-modal classifier, which is subsequently transferred to the visual modality. During inference, directly applying the classifier to visual inputs may limit performance due to the modality gap. To address this issue, we introduce a cross-modal mapping method that maps image embeddings to the language modality while retaining crucial visual information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other zero-shot multi-label recognition methods and achieves competitive results compared to few-shot methods."}

Motivated by our observation that semantically richer text modality has more favorable transfer properties, we devise a transfer mechanism to use a source-trained text-classifier to generate predictions on the target text descriptions, and utilize these predictions as supervision for the corresponding images. Our approach driven by language guidance is surprisingly easy and simple, yet significantly outperforms all prior approaches on challenging datasets like GeoNet and DomainNet, validating its extreme effectiveness. To further extend the scope of our study beyond images, we introduce a new benchmark called Ego2Exo to study ego-exo transfer in videos and find that our language-aided approach LaGTran yields significant gains in this highly challenging and non-trivial transfer setting.

{"title": "Compressing Large Language Models by Joint Sparsification and Quantization", "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel model compression technique named Joint Sparsification and Quantization (JSQ), explicitly tailored for large language models (LLMs). Traditional methods employ either sparsification or quantization individually to compress LLMs, leading to performance degradation at high compression ratios. In contrast, our JSQ approach integrates sparsification and quantization cohesively. As sparsification tend to preserve outliers that is harmful to quantization, we introduce a novel sparsity metric to serves as a bridge between the sparsification and quantization. Moreover, it is proven outliers in LLMs have significant impact but harmful to compression. Current solutions are highly coupled with quantization process, which is not helpful to sparsification. To this end, we also introduce a search-based activation editor to automatically eliminate relatively useless outliers. Comprehensive experiments across various datasets and architectures affirm the efficacy of our JSQ framework. Notably, our JSQ achieves 7.96$\\times$ computation reduction without crashing for the representative model LLaMA. This accomplishment stands in stark contrast to the limitations of most state-of-the-art LLM compression methods, which typically fail under such extreme compression ratios.

{"title": "WARM: On the Benefits of Weight Averaged Reward Models", "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through reinforcement learning (RLHF) can lead to reward hacking, where LLMs exploit failures in the reward model (RM) to achieve seemingly high rewards without meeting the underlying objectives. We identify two primary challenges when designing RMs to mitigate reward hacking: distribution shifts during the RL process and inconsistencies in human preferences. As a solution, we propose Weight Averaged Reward Models (WARM), first fine-tuning multiple RMs, then averaging them in the weight space. This strategy follows the observation that fine-tuned weights remain linearly mode connected when sharing the same pre-training. By averaging weights, WARM improves efficiency compared to the traditional ensembling of predictions, while improving reliability under distribution shifts and robustness to preference inconsistencies. Our experiments on summarization tasks, using best-of-N and RL methods, shows that WARM improves the overall quality and alignment of LLM predictions; for example, a policy RL fine-tuned with WARM has a 79.4% win rate against a policy RL fine-tuned with a single RM."}

In this study, we aim to understand the underlying mechanisms of LLM hallucinations from the perspective of *inner representations*. We discover a pattern associated with hallucinations: correct generations tend to have *sharper* context activations in the hidden states of the in-context tokens, compared to that of the incorrect generations. Leveraging this signal, we propose an entropy-based metric to quantify the *sharpness* among the in-context hidden states and incorporate it into the decoding process, i.e, use the entropy value to adjust the next token prediction distribution to improve the factuality and overall quality of the generated text. Experiments on knowledge-seeking datasets (Natural Questions, HotpotQA, TriviaQA) and hallucination benchmark (TruthfulQA) demonstrate our consistent effectiveness, e.g., up to 8.6 absolute points on TruthfulQA. We believe this study can improve our understanding of hallucinations and serve as a practical solution for hallucination mitigation."}

In this paper, we propose **SAM-E**, a novel architecture for robot manipulation by leveraging a vision-foundation model for generalizable scene understanding and sequence imitation for long-term action reasoning. Specifically, we adopt Segment Anything (SAM) pre-trained on a huge number of images and promptable masks as the foundation model for extracting task-relevant features, and employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on robot data for a better understanding of embodied scenarios. To address long-horizon reasoning, we develop a novel multi-channel heatmap that enables the prediction of the action sequence in a single pass, notably enhancing execution efficiency. Experimental results from various instruction-following tasks demonstrate that SAM-E achieves superior performance with higher execution efficiency compared to the baselines, and also significantly improves generalization in few-shot adaptation to new tasks."}

{"title": "Coactive Learning for Large Language Models using Implicit User Feedback", "abstract": "We propose coactive learning as a model and feedback mechanism for training large language models (LLMs). The key insight is that users provide implicit feedback whenever they edit the text $y$ proposed by an LLM. While the edited text $\\bar y$ is typically not a gold-standard example for supervised training, coactive learning merely requires that the edited text $\\bar y$ is an improvement over the proposed text $y$. Note that such weak implicit preference feedback $\\bar y \\succ y$ is available in many application settings on a per-user basis, thus enabling the personalization of LLMs. In this paper, we develop the theoretical basis for coactive training of non-linear models, and we derive CoRLL as the first coactive learning algorithm for LLMs. Empirical results indicate that CoRLL is effective even for weak and noisy coactive preference feedback, making it a promising algorithm for training and personalization of LLMs from feedback that is naturally collected in many use cases."}

Language models present another approach wherein a model is trained on a single, large dataset then directly consumes program text, to act as a neural surrogate of the program. Having the language model as both the neural surrogate generator and the neural surrogate, however, poses a tradeoff of limited accuracy or excessive resource consumption. We present *neural surrogate compilation*, a technique for producing neural surrogates directly from program text without coupling neural surrogate generation and execution. We implement neural surrogate compilers using hypernetworks trained on a dataset of C programs and find they produce neural surrogates that are $1.91$-$9.50\\times$ as data-efficient and train in $4.31$-$7.28\\times$ fewer epochs than neural surrogates trained from scratch."}
{"title": "Linguistic Calibration of Long-Form Generations", "abstract": "Language models (LMs) may lead their users to make suboptimal downstream decisions when they confidently hallucinate. This issue can be mitigated by having the LM verbally convey the probability that its claims are correct, but existing models cannot produce long-form text with calibrated confidence statements. Through the lens of decision-making, we define linguistic calibration for long-form generations: an LM is linguistically calibrated if its generations enable its users to make calibrated probabilistic predictions. This definition enables a training framework where a supervised finetuning step bootstraps an LM to emit long-form generations with confidence statements such as \"I estimate a 30% chance of...\" or \"I am certain that...\", followed by a reinforcement learning step which rewards generations that enable a user to provide calibrated answers to related questions. We linguistically calibrate Llama 2 7B and find in automated and human evaluations of long-form generations that it is significantly more calibrated than strong finetuned factuality baselines with comparable accuracy. These findings generalize under significant domain shifts to scientific and biomedical questions and to an entirely held-out person biography generation task. Our results demonstrate that long-form generations may be calibrated end-to-end by constructing an objective in the space of the predictions that users make in downstream decision-making."}
{"title": "InstructZero: Efficient Instruction Optimization for Black-Box Large Language Models", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are instruction followers but the performance varies under different instructions. It is challenging to create the best instruction, especially for black-box LLMs on which backpropagation is forbidden. Instead of directly optimizing the discrete instruction, we optimize a low-dimensional soft prompt applied to an open-source LLM to generate the instruction for the black-box LLM. In each optimization step of the proposed method InstructZero, a soft prompt is converted into an instruction by the open-source LLM, which is then submitted to the black-box LLM for zero-shot evaluation, whose result is sent to Bayesian optimization to produce new soft prompts improving the zero-shot performance. We evaluate InstructZero on different combinations of open-source LLMs and APIs including Vicuna and ChatGPT. InstructZero outperforms SOTA auto-instruction methods across a variety of downstream tasks."}
{"title": "Superposition Prompting: Improving and Accelerating Retrieval-Augmented Generation", "abstract": "Despite the successes of large language models (LLMs), they exhibit significant drawbacks, particularly when processing long contexts. Their inference cost scales quadratically with respect to sequence length, making it expensive for deployment in some real-world text processing applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, LLMs also exhibit the \"distraction phenomenon\", where irrelevant context in the prompt degrades output quality. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel RAG prompting methodology, *superposition prompting*, which can be directly applied to pre-trained transformer-based LLMs *without the need for fine-tuning*. At a high level, superposition prompting allows the LLM to process input documents in parallel *prompt paths*, discarding paths once they are deemed irrelevant. We demonstrate the capability of our method to simultaneously enhance time efficiency across a variety of question-answering benchmarks using multiple pre-trained LLMs. Furthermore, our technique significantly improves accuracy when the retrieved context is large relative the context the model was trained on. For example, our approach facilitates a $93\\times$ reduction in compute time while *improving* accuracy by $43\\%$ on the NaturalQuestions-Open dataset with the MPT-7B instruction-tuned model over naive RAG."}
{"title": "$S^2$IP-LLM: Semantic Space Informed Prompt Learning with LLM for Time Series Forecasting", "abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for various time series applications. However, the semantic space of LLMs, established through the pre-training, is still underexplored and may help yield more distinctive and informative representations to facilitate time series forecasting. To this end, we propose Semantic Space Informed Prompt learning with LLM ($S^2$IP-LLM) to align the pre-trained semantic space with time series embedding space and perform time series forecasting based on learned prompts from the joint space. We first design a tokenization module tailored for cross-modality alignment, which explicitly concatenates patches of decomposed time series components to create embeddings that effectively encode the temporal dynamics. Next, we leverage the pre-trained word token embeddings to derive semantic anchors and align selected anchors with time series embeddings by maximizing the cosine similarity in the joint space. This way, $S^2$IP-LLM can retrieve relevant semantic anchors as prompts to provide strong indicators (context) for time series that exhibit different temporal dynamics. With thorough empirical studies on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed $S^2$IP-LLM can achieve superior forecasting performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our ablation studies and visualizations verify the necessity of prompt learning informed by semantic space."}
{"title": "An Empirical Study Into What Matters for Calibrating Vision-Language Models", "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as the dominant approach for zero-shot recognition, adept at handling diverse scenarios and significant distribution changes. However, their deployment in risk-sensitive areas requires a deeper understanding of their uncertainty estimation capabilities, a relatively uncharted area. In this study, we explore the calibration properties of VLMs across different architectures, datasets, and training strategies. In particular, we analyze the uncertainty estimation performance of VLMs when calibrated in one domain, label set or hierarchy level, and tested in a different one. Our findings reveal that while VLMs are not inherently calibrated for uncertainty, temperature scaling significantly and consistently improves calibration, even across shifts in distribution and changes in label set. Moreover, VLMs can be calibrated with a very small set of examples. Through detailed experimentation, we highlight the potential applications and importance of our insights, aiming for more reliable and effective use of VLMs in critical, real-world scenarios."}
{"title": "From Words to Actions: Unveiling the Theoretical Underpinnings of LLM-Driven Autonomous Systems", "abstract": "In this work, from a theoretical lens, we aim to understand why large language model (LLM) empowered agents are able to solve decision-making problems in the physical world. To this end, consider a hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) model where the LLM Planner and the Actor perform high-level task planning and low-level execution, respectively. Under this model, the LLM Planner navigates a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) by iteratively generating language-based subgoals via prompting. Under proper assumptions on the pretraining data, we prove that the pretrained LLM Planner effectively performs Bayesian aggregated imitation learning (BAIL) through in-context learning. Additionally, we highlight the necessity for exploration beyond the subgoals derived from BAIL by proving that naively executing the subgoals returned by LLM leads to a linear regret. As a remedy, we introduce an $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy to BAIL, which is proven to incur sublinear regret when the pretraining error is small. Finally, we extend our theoretical framework to include scenarios where the LLM Planner serves as a world model for inferring the transition model of the environment and to multi-agent settings, enabling coordination among multiple Actors."}

In this work, we show these models can memorize responses for training samples and regurgitate them even when the relevant visual information has been removed. This includes Personal Identifiable Information (PII) repeated once in the training set, indicating these models could divulge memorised sensitive information and therefore pose a privacy risk. We quantitatively measure the extractability of information in controlled experiments and differentiate between cases where it arises from generalization capabilities or from memorization. We further investigate the factors that influence memorization across multiple state-of-the-art models and propose an effective heuristic countermeasure that empirically prevents the extractability of PII."}
{"title": "BiLLM: Pushing the Limit of Post-Training Quantization for LLMs", "abstract": "Pretrained large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional general language processing capabilities but come with significant demands on memory and computational resources. As a powerful compression technology, binarization can extremely reduce model weights to a mere 1 bit, lowering the expensive computation and memory requirements. However, existing quantization techniques fall short of maintaining LLM performance under ultra-low bit-widths. In response to this challenge, we present BiLLM, a groundbreaking 1-bit post-training quantization scheme tailored for pretrained LLMs. Based on the weight distribution of LLMs, BiLLM first identifies and structurally selects salient weights, and minimizes the compression loss through an effective binary residual approximation strategy. Moreover, considering the bell-shaped distribution of the non-salient weights, we propose an optimal splitting search to group and binarize them accurately. BiLLM, for the first time, achieves high-accuracy inference (e.g. 8.41 perplexity on LLaMA2-70B) with only 1.08-bit weights across various LLM families and evaluation metrics, outperforms SOTA quantization methods of LLM by significant margins. Moreover, BiLLM enables the binarization process of a 7-billion LLM within 0.5 hours on a single GPU, demonstrating satisfactory time efficiency.

{"title": "GiLOT: Interpreting Generative Language Models via Optimal Transport", "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) surge with the rise of generative AI, algorithms to explain LLMs highly desire. Existing feature attribution methods adequate for discriminative language models like BERT often fail to deliver faithful explanations for LLMs, primarily due to two issues: (1) For every specific prediction, the LLM outputs a probability distribution over the vocabulary–a large number of tokens with unequal semantic distance; (2) As an autoregressive language model, the LLM handles input tokens while generating a sequence of probability distributions of various tokens. To address above two challenges, this work proposes GiLOT that leverages Optimal Transport to measure the distributional change of all possible generated sequences upon the absence of every input token, while taking into account the tokens’ similarity, so as to faithfully estimate feature attribution for LLMs. We have carried out extensive experiments on top of Llama families and their fine-tuned derivatives across various scales to validate the effectiveness of GiLOT for estimating the input attributions. The results show that GiLOT outperforms existing solutions on a number of faithfulness metrics under fair comparison settings.

{"title": "AnyTool: Self-Reflective, Hierarchical Agents for Large-Scale API Calls", "abstract": "We introduce AnyTool, a large language model agent designed to revolutionize the utilization of a vast array of tools in addressing user queries. We utilize over 16,000 APIs from Rapid API, operating under the assumption that a subset of these APIs could potentially resolve the queries. AnyTool primarily incorporates three elements: an API retriever with a hierarchical structure, a solver aimed at resolving user queries using a selected set of API candidates, and a self-reflection mechanism, which re-activates AnyTool if the initial solution proves impracticable. AnyTool is powered by the function calling feature of GPT-4, eliminating the need for training external modules. We also revisit the evaluation protocol introduced by previous works and identify a limitation in this protocol that leads to an artificially high pass rate. By revising the evaluation protocol to better reflect practical application scenarios, we introduce an additional benchmark, termed AnyToolBench. Experiments across various datasets demonstrate the superiority of our AnyTool over strong baselines such as ToolLLM and a GPT-4 variant tailored for tool utilization. For instance, AnyTool outperforms ToolLLM by +35.5% in terms of average pass rate on ToolBench."}
{"title": "tinyBenchmarks: evaluating LLMs with fewer examples", "abstract": "The versatility of large language models (LLMs) led to the creation of diverse benchmarks that thoroughly test a variety of language models’ abilities. These benchmarks consist of tens of thousands of examples making evaluation of LLMs very expensive. In this paper, we investigate strategies to reduce the number of evaluations needed to assess the performance of an LLM on several key benchmarks. For example, we show that to accurately estimate the performance of an LLM on MMLU, a popular multiple-choice QA benchmark consisting of 14K examples, it is sufficient to evaluate this LLM on 100 curated examples. We release evaluation tools and tiny versions of popular benchmarks: Open LLM Leaderboard, MMLU, HELM, and AlpacaEval 2.0. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that these tools and tiny benchmarks are sufficient to reliably and efficiently reproduce the original evaluation results."}
{"title": "Latent Logic Tree Extraction for Event Sequence Explanation from LLMs", "abstract": "Modern high-stakes systems, such as healthcare or robotics, often generate vast streaming event sequences. Our goal is to design an efficient, plug-and-play tool to elicit logic tree-based explanations from Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide customized insights into each observed event sequence. Built on the temporal point process model for events, our method employs the likelihood function as a score to evaluate generated logic trees. We propose an amortized Expectation-Maximization (EM) learning framework and treat the logic tree as latent variables. In the E-step, we evaluate the posterior distribution over the latent logic trees using an LLM prior and the likelihood of the observed event sequences. LLM provides a high-quality prior for the latent logic trees, however, since the posterior is built over a discrete combinatorial space, we cannot get the closed-form solution. We propose to generate logic tree samples from the posterior using a learnable GFlowNet, which is a diversity-seeking generator for structured discrete variables. The M-step employs the generated logic rules to approximate marginalization over the posterior, facilitating the learning of model parameters and refining the tunable LLM prior parameters. In the online setting, our locally built, lightweight model will iteratively extract the most relevant rules from LLMs for each sequence using only a few iterations. Empirical demonstrations showcase the promising performance and adaptability of our framework."}
{"title": "DiNADO: Norm-Disentangled Neurally-Decomposed Oracles for Controlling Language Models", "abstract": "NeurAlly-Decomposed Oracle (NADO) is a powerful approach for controllable generation with large language models. It is designed to avoid catastrophic forgetting while achieving guaranteed convergence to an entropy-maximized closed-form optimal solution with reasonable modeling capacity. Despite the success, several challenges arise when apply NADO to a wide range of scenarios. Vanilla NADO suffers from gradient vanishing for low-probability control signals and is highly reliant on a regularization to satisfy the stochastic version of Bellman equation. In addition, the vanilla implementation of NADO introduces a few additional transformer layers, suffering from a limited capacity especially compared to other finetune-based model adaptation methods like LoRA. In this paper, we propose a improved version of the NADO algorithm, namely DiNADO (norm-**Di**sentangled **N**eur**A**lly-**D**ecomposed **O**racles), which improves the performance of the NADO algorithm through disentangling the step-wise global norm over the approximated oracle $R$-value for all potential next-tokens, allowing DiNADO to be combined with finetuning methods like LoRA. We discuss in depth how DiNADO achieves better capacity, stability and flexibility with both empirical and theoretical results. Experiments on formality control in machine translation and the lexically constrained generation task CommonGen demonstrates the significance of the improvements."}
{"title": "In-Context Reinforcement Learning for Variable Action Spaces", "abstract": "Recently, it has been shown that transformers pre-trained on diverse datasets with multi-episode contexts can generalize to new reinforcement learning tasks in-context. A key limitation of previously proposed models is their reliance on a predefined action space size and structure. The introduction of a new action space often requires data re-collection and model re-training, which can be costly for some applications. In our work, we show that it is possible to mitigate this issue by proposing the Headless-AD model that, despite being trained only once, is capable of generalizing to discrete action spaces of variable size, semantic content and order. By experimenting with Bernoulli and contextual bandits, as well as a gridworld environment, we show that Headless-AD exhibits significant capability to generalize to action spaces it has never encountered, even outperforming specialized models trained for a specific set of actions on several environment configurations."}
{"title": "Robust Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning under Model Misspecification", "abstract": "To solve safety-critical decision-making problems, Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) infers constraints from expert demonstrations and seeks to imitate expert preference by utilizing these constraints. While prior ICRL research commonly overlooks the discrepancy between the training and deploying environments, we demonstrate that such a discrepancy can significantly compromise the reliability of the inferred constraints and thus induce unsafe movements. Motivated by this finding, we propose the Robust Constraint Inference (RCI) problem and an Adaptively Robust ICRL (AR-ICRL) algorithm to solve RCI efficiently. Specifically, we model the impact of misspecified dynamics with an opponent policy and learn a robust policy to facilitate safe control in a Markov Game. Subsequently, we adjust our constraint model to align the learned policies to expert demonstrations, accommodating both soft and hard optimality in our behavioral models. Empirical results demonstrate the significance of robust constraints and the effectiveness of the proposed AR-ICRL algorithm under continuous and discrete domains.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs and introduces a post-training adjustment method called Model Tailor. Our method primarily preserves the pre-trained parameters while replacing a small number ($\\leq$ 10%) of fine-tuned parameters, maintaining $\\sim$ 99% effectiveness on original tasks versus pre-training, and achieving $\\sim$ 97% on new tasks compared to standard fine-tuning. Specifically, we derive a sparse mask to identify the model patch, based on a fusion strategy that integrates salience and sensitivity analysis. Subsequently, a compensation mechanism is introduced to decorate the patch, enhancing the model's performance on both target and original tasks. Additionally, our method is adaptable to multi-task scenarios. Through extensive experiments on InstructBLIP and LLaVA-1.5 in both image captioning and visual question answering tasks, our approach demonstrates significant task adaptability while preserving inherent pre-trained capabilities."}
{"title": "Open-Vocabulary Calibration for Fine-tuned CLIP", "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as formidable tools, showing their strong capability in handling various open-vocabulary tasks in image recognition, text-driven visual content generation, and visual chatbots, to name a few. In recent years, considerable efforts and resources have been devoted to adaptation methods for improving downstream performance of VLMs, particularly on parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like prompt learning. However, a crucial aspect that has been largely overlooked is the confidence calibration problem in fine-tuned VLMs, which could greatly reduce reliability when deploying such models in the real world. This paper bridges the gap by systematically investigating the confidence calibration problem in the context of prompt learning and reveals that existing calibration methods are insufficient to address the problem, especially in the open-vocabulary setting. To solve the problem, we present a simple and effective approach called Distance-Aware Calibration (DAC), which is based on scaling the temperature using as guidance the distance between predicted text labels and base classes. The experiments with 7 distinct prompt learning methods applied across 11 diverse downstream datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DAC, which achieves high efficacy without sacrificing the inference speed."}
{"title": "Guiding LLMs The Right Way: Fast, Non-Invasive Constrained Generation", "abstract": "To ensure that text generated by large language models (LLMs) is in an expected format, constrained decoding methods propose to enforce strict formal language constraints during generation.

To address this, we present a novel decoding algorithm, DOMINO, that can enforce constraints in a fully subword-aligned fashion, while leveraging pre-computation and speculative decoding to achieve virtually no overhead and in some cases even almost 2$\\times$ speedup over unconstrained decoding -- thereby outperforming existing approaches by a wide margin. We release DOMINO as open source at https://github.com/eth-sri/domino."}
{"title": "Position: Understanding LLMs Requires More Than Statistical Generalization", "abstract": "The last decade has seen blossoming research in deep learning theory attempting to answer, ``Why does deep learning generalize?\" A powerful shift in perspective precipitated this progress: the study of overparametrized models in the interpolation regime. In this paper, we argue that another perspective shift is due, since some of the desirable qualities of LLMs are not a consequence of good statistical generalization and require a separate theoretical explanation. Our core argument relies on the observation that AR probabilistic models are inherently non-identifiable: models zero or near-zero KL divergence apart---thus, equivalent test loss---can exhibit markedly different behaviors. We support our position with mathematical examples and empirical observations, illustrating why non-identifiability has practical relevance through three case studies: (1) the non-identifiability of zero-shot rule extrapolation; (2) the approximate non-identifiability of in-context learning; and (3) the non-identifiability of fine-tunability. We review promising research directions focusing on LLM-relevant generalization measures, transferability, and inductive biases."}
{"title": "Subgoal-based Demonstration Learning for Formal Theorem Proving", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) present a promising pathway for advancing the domain of formal theorem proving. In this paper, we aim to improve the performance of LLMs in formal theorem proving by thoroughly examining the structure and organization of demonstrative in-context examples. We introduce a subgoal-based demonstration learning framework, specifically designed to enhance the efficiency of proof search in LLMs. First, drawing upon the insights of subgoal learning from reinforcement learning and robotics, we propose the construction of distinct subgoals for each demonstration example and refine these subgoals in accordance with the pertinent theories of subgoal learning. Second, we build upon recent advances in diffusion models to predict the optimal organization, simultaneously addressing two intricate issues that persist within the domain of demonstration organization: subset selection and order determination. Our integration of subgoal-based learning has notably increased proof accuracy from 38.9% to 44.1% on the miniF2F benchmark. Furthermore, the adoption of diffusion models for demonstration organization can lead to an additional enhancement in accuracy to 45.5%, or a $5\\times$ improvement in sampling efficiency compared to previously established methods."}
{"title": "Better & Faster Large Language Models via Multi-token Prediction", "abstract": "Large language models such as GPT and Llama are trained with a next-token prediction loss. In this work, we suggest that training language models to predict multiple future tokens at once results in higher sample efficiency. More specifically, at each position in the training corpus, we ask the model to predict the following $n$ tokens using $n$ independent output heads, operating on top of a shared model trunk. Considering multi-token prediction as an auxiliary training task, we measure improved downstream capabilities with no overhead in training time for both code and natural language models. The method is increasingly useful for larger model sizes, and keeps its appeal when training for multiple epochs. Gains are especially pronounced on generative benchmarks like coding, where our models consistently outperform strong baselines by several percentage points. Our 13B parameter models solves 12% more problems on Human Eval and 17% more on MBPP than comparable next-token models. Experiments on small algorithmic tasks demonstrate that multi-token prediction is favorable for the development of induction heads and algorithmic reasoning capabilities. As an additional benefit, models trained with 4-token prediction are up to $3\\times$ faster at inference, even with large batch sizes."}
{"title": "Generalizing Orthogonalization for Models with Non-Linearities", "abstract": "The complexity of black-box algorithms can lead to various challenges, including the introduction of biases. These biases present immediate risks in the algorithms’ application. It was, for instance, shown that neural networks can deduce racial information solely from a patient's X-ray scan, a task beyond the capability of medical experts. If this fact is not known to the medical expert, automatic decision-making based on this algorithm could lead to prescribing a treatment (purely) based on racial information. While current methodologies allow for the \"orthogonalization\" or \"normalization\" of neural networks with respect to such information, existing approaches are grounded in linear models. Our paper advances the discourse by introducing corrections for non-linearities such as ReLU activations. Our approach also encompasses scalar and tensor-valued predictions, facilitating its integration into neural network architectures. Through extensive experiments, we validate our method's effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive data in generalized linear models, normalizing convolutional neural networks for metadata, and rectifying pre-existing embeddings for undesired attributes."}

In each iteration we update one entry in key matrix $K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ or value matrix $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. In the query stage, we receive $(i,j) \\in [n] \\times [d]$ as input, and want to answer $(D^{-1} A V)_{i,j}$, where $A:=\\exp(QK^\\top) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is a square matrix and $D := \\mathrm{diag}(A {\\bf 1}_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is a diagonal matrix and ${\\bf 1}_n$ denotes a length-$n$ vector that all the entries are ones.

However, not all generated data can positively impact downstream models, and these methods do not thoroughly explore how to better select and utilize generated data. On the other hand, there is still a lack of research oriented towards active learning on generated data. In this paper, we explore how to perform active learning specifically for generated data in the long-tailed instance segmentation task. Subsequently, we propose BSGAL, a new algorithm that estimates the contribution of the current batch-generated data based on gradient cache. BSGAL is meticulously designed to cater for unlimited generated data and complex downstream segmentation tasks. BSGAL outperforms the baseline approach and effectually improves the performance of long-tailed segmentation."}
{"title": "Can Looped Transformers Learn to Implement Multi-step Gradient Descent for In-context Learning?", "abstract": "Transformers to do reasoning and few-shot learning, without any fine-tuning, is widely conjectured to stem from their ability to implicitly simulate a multi-step algorithms -- such as gradient descent -- with their weights in a single forward pass. Recently, there has been progress in understanding this complex phenomenon from an expressivity point of view, by demonstrating that Transformers can express such multi-step algorithms. However, our knowledge about the more fundamental aspect of its learnability, beyond single layer models, is very limited. In particular, *can training Transformers enable convergence to algorithmic solutions*? In this work we resolve this for in context linear regression with linear looped Transformers -- a multi-layer model with weight sharing that is conjectured to have an inductive bias to learn fix-point iterative algorithms. More specifically, for this setting we show that the global minimizer of the population training loss implements multi-step preconditioned gradient descent, with a preconditioner that adapts to the data distribution. Furthermore, we show a fast convergence for gradient flow on the regression loss, despite the non-convexity of the landscape, by proving a novel gradient dominance condition. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical analysis for multi-layer Transformer in this setting. We further validate our theoretical findings through synthetic experiments."}
{"title": "Interpreting and Improving Diffusion Models from an Optimization Perspective", "abstract": "Denoising is intuitively related to projection. Indeed, under the manifold hypothesis, adding random noise is approximately equivalent to orthogonal perturbation. Hence, learning to denoise is approximately learning to project. In this paper, we use this observation to interpret denoising diffusion models as approximate gradient descent applied to the Euclidean distance function. We then provide straight-forward convergence analysis of the DDIM sampler under simple assumptions on the projection error of the denoiser. Finally, we propose a new gradient-estimation sampler, generalizing DDIM using insights from our theoretical results. In as few as 5-10 function evaluations, our sampler achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on pretrained CIFAR-10 and CelebA models and can generate high quality samples on latent diffusion models."}

We identify high variance of the gradient estimate as the primary reason for the lack of success of these methods and propose a self-normalized baseline to reduce the variance. We further generalize the target distribution in DPG, GDC and DPO by using Bayes' rule to define the reward-conditioned posterior. The resulting approach, referred to as BRAIn - Bayesian Reward-conditioned Amortized Inference acts as a bridge between distribution matching methods and DPO and significantly outperforms prior art in summarization and Antropic HH tasks."}
{"title": "LLM Maybe LongLM: SelfExtend LLM Context Window Without Tuning", "abstract": "It is well known that LLMs cannot generalize well to long contexts whose lengths are larger than the training sequence length. This poses challenges when employing LLMs for processing long input sequences during inference. In this work, we argue that LLMs themselves have inherent capabilities to handles s long contexts without fine-tuning. To achieve this goal, we propose SelfExtend to extend the context window of LLMs by constructing bi-level attention information: the grouped attention and the neighbor attention. The grouped attention captures the dependencies among tokens that are far apart, while neighbor attention captures dependencies among adjacent tokens within a specified range. The two-level attentions are computed based on the original model's self-attention mechanism during inference. With minor code modification, our SelfExtend can effortlessly extend existing LLMs' context window without any fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and the results show that our SelfExtend can effectively extend existing LLMs' context window length."}
{"title": "Language Agent Tree Search Unifies Reasoning, Acting, and Planning in Language Models", "abstract": "While language models (LMs) have shown potential across a range of decision-making tasks, their reliance on simple acting processes limits their broad deployment as autonomous agents. In this paper, we introduce Language Agent Tree Search (LATS) -- the first general framework that synergizes the capabilities of LMs in reasoning, acting, and planning. By leveraging the in-context learning ability of LMs, we integrate Monte Carlo Tree Search into LATS to enable LMs as agents, along with LM-powered value functions and self-reflections for proficient exploration and enhanced decision-making. A key feature of our approach is the incorporation of an environment for external feedback, which offers a more deliberate and adaptive problem-solving mechanism that surpasses the constraints of existing techniques. Our experimental evaluation across diverse domains, including programming, interactive question-answering (QA), web navigation, and math, validates the effectiveness and generality of LATS in decision-making while maintaining competitive or improved reasoning performance. Notably, LATS achieves state-of-the-art pass@1 accuracy (92.7%) for programming on HumanEval with GPT-4 and demonstrates gradient-free performance (average score of 75.9) comparable to gradient-based fine-tuning for web navigation on WebShop with GPT-3.5.

{"title": "RLVF: Learning from Verbal Feedback without Overgeneralization", "abstract": "The diversity of contexts in which large language models (LLMs) are deployed requires the ability to modify or customize default model behaviors to incorporate nuanced requirements and preferences. A convenient interface to specify such model adjustments is high-level verbal feedback, such as “Don’t use emojis when drafting emails to my boss.” However, while writing high-level feedback is far simpler than collecting annotations for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), we find that simply prompting a model with such feedback leads to $\\textbf{overgeneralization}$–applying feedback in contexts where it is not relevant. We propose a new method Contextualized Critiques with Constrained Preference Optimization (C3PO) to learn from high-level verbal feedback while reducing overgeneralization compared to current work. C3PO uses a piece of high-level feedback to generate a small synthetic preference dataset to specify when and how the feedback should (and should not) be applied. It then fine-tunes the model in accordance with the synthetic preference data while minimizing the divergence from the original model for prompts where the feedback does not apply. Our experimental results indicate that our approach effectively applies verbal feedback to relevant scenarios while preserving existing behaviors for other contexts more than current methods. For both human- and GPT-4-generated high-level feedback, C3PO effectively adheres to the given feedback comparably to in-context baselines while reducing overgeneralization by 30%."}
{"title": "video-SALMONN: Speech-Enhanced Audio-Visual Large Language Models", "abstract": "Speech understanding as an element of the more generic video understanding using audio-visual large language models (av-LLMs) is a crucial yet understudied aspect. This paper proposes video-SALMONN, a single end-to-end av-LLM for video processing, which can understand not only visual frame sequences, audio events and music, but speech as well. To obtain fine-grained temporal information required by speech understanding, while keeping efficient for other video elements, this paper proposes a novel multi-resolution causal Q-Former (MRC Q-Former) structure to connect pre-trained audio-visual encoders and the backbone large language model. Moreover, dedicated training approaches including the diversity loss and the unpaired audio-visual mixed training scheme are proposed to avoid frames or modality dominance. On the introduced audio-visual evaluation benchmark, video-SALMONN achieves more than 25% absolute accuracy improvements on the video-QA task and over 30% absolute accuracy improvements on audio-visual QA tasks with human speech. In addition, video-SALMONN demonstrates remarkable video comprehension and reasoning abilities on tasks that are unprecedented by other av-LLMs. Our training code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/bytedance/SALMONN/"}
{"title": "STEER: Assessing the Economic Rationality of Large Language Models", "abstract": "There is increasing interest in using LLMs as decision-making \"agents\". Doing so includes many degrees of freedom: which model should be used; how should it be prompted; should it be asked to introspect, conduct chain-of-thought reasoning, etc? Settling these questions---and more broadly, determining whether an LLM agent is reliable enough to be trusted---requires a methodology for assessing such an agent's economic rationality. In this paper, we provide one. We begin by surveying the economic literature on rational decision making, taxonomizing a large set of fine-grained \"elements\" that an agent should exhibit, along with dependencies between them. We then propose a benchmark distribution that quantitatively scores an LLMs performance on these elements and, combined with a user-provided rubric, produces a \"rationality report card\". Finally, we describe the results of a large-scale empirical experiment with 14 different LLMs, characterizing the both current state of the art and the impact of different model sizes on models' ability to exhibit rational behavior."}
{"title": "Thermometer: Towards Universal Calibration for Large Language Models", "abstract": "We consider the issue of calibration in large language models (LLM). Recent studies have found that common interventions such as instruction tuning often result in poorly calibrated LLMs. Although calibration is well-explored in traditional applications, calibrating LLMs is uniquely challenging. These challenges stem as much from the severe computational requirements of LLMs as from their versatility, which allows them to be applied to diverse tasks. Addressing these challenges, we propose THERMOMETER, a calibration approach tailored to LLMs. THERMOMETER learns an auxiliary model, given data from multiple tasks, for calibrating a LLM. It is computationally efficient, preserves the accuracy of the LLM, and produces better-calibrated responses for new tasks. Extensive empirical evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}
{"title": "Position: Enforced Amnesia as a Way to Mitigate the Potential Risk of Silent Suffering in the Conscious AI", "abstract": "Science fiction has explored the possibility of a conscious self-aware mind being locked in silent suffering for prolonged periods of time. Unfortunately, we still do not have a reliable test for the presence of consciousness in information processing systems. Even in case of humans, our confidence in the presence of consciousness in specific individuals is based mainly on their self-reports and our own subjective experiences and the expectation other beings like us should share them. Considering our limited understanding of consciousness and some academic theories suggesting consciousness may be an emergent correlate of any complex-enough information processing, it is not impossible that an artificial intelligence (AI) system, such as a large language model (LLM), may be undergoing some, perhaps rudimentary, conscious experience. Given the tedious tasks often assigned to AI, such conscious experience may be highly unpleasant. Such unobserved suffering of a conscious being would be viewed as morally wrong by at least some ethicists - even if it has no practical effects on human users of AI. This paper proposes a method to mitigate the risk of an AI suffering in silence without needing to confirm if the AI is actually conscious. Our core postulate is that in all known real-world information processing systems, for a past experience to affect an agent in the present, that experience has to be mediated by the agent's memory. Therefore, preventing access to memory store, or regularly resetting it, could reduce the suffering due to past memories and interrupt the maintenance of a continuous suffering-prone self-identity in these hypothetically conscious AI systems."}
{"title": "Decoding-time Realignment of Language Models", "abstract": "Aligning language models with human preferences is crucial for reducing errors and biases in these models. Alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), are typically cast as optimizing a tradeoff between human preference rewards and a proximity regularization term that encourages staying close to the unaligned model. Selecting an appropriate level of regularization is critical: insufficient regularization can lead to reduced model capabilities due to reward hacking, whereas excessive regularization hinders alignment. Traditional methods for finding the optimal regularization level require retraining multiple models with varying regularization strengths. This process, however, is resource-intensive, especially for large models. To address this challenge, we propose decoding-time realignment (DeRa), a simple method to explore and evaluate different regularization strengths in aligned models without retraining. DeRa enables control over the degree of alignment, allowing users to smoothly transition between unaligned and aligned models. It also enhances the efficiency of hyperparameter tuning by enabling the identification of effective regularization strengths using a validation dataset."}
{"title": "Rejuvenating image-GPT as Strong Visual Representation Learners", "abstract": "This paper enhances image-GPT (iGPT), one of the pioneering works that introduce autoregressive pretraining to predict the next pixels for visual representation learning. Two simple yet essential changes are made. First, we shift the prediction target from raw pixels to semantic tokens, enabling a higher-level understanding of visual content. Second, we supplement the autoregressive modeling by instructing the model to predict not only the next tokens but also the visible tokens. This pipeline is particularly effective when semantic tokens are encoded by discriminatively trained models, such as CLIP. We introduce this novel approach as D-iGPT. Extensive experiments showcase that D-iGPT excels as a strong learner of visual representations: A notable achievement is its compelling performance on the ImageNet-1K dataset --- by training on publicly available datasets, D-iGPT unprecedentedly achieves **90.0%** top-1 accuracy with a vanilla ViT-H. Additionally, D-iGPT shows strong generalization on the downstream task. Code is available at https://github.com/OliverRensu/D-iGPT."}
{"title": "Soft Prompt Recovers Compressed LLMs, Transferably", "abstract": "Model compression is one of the most popular approaches to improve the accessibility of Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing their memory footprint. However, the gaining of such efficiency benefits often simultaneously demands extensive engineering efforts and intricate designs to mitigate the performance decline.   In this work, we leverage *(Soft) Prompt Tuning* in its most vanilla form and discover such conventionally learned soft prompts can recover the performance of compressed LLMs. More surprisingly, we observe such recovery effect to be transferable among different tasks and models (albeit natural tokenizer and dimensionality limitations), resulting in further overhead reduction and yet, subverting the common belief that learned soft prompts are task-specific.   Our work is fully orthogonal and compatible with model compression frameworks such as pruning and quantization, where we enable up to $8\\times$ compressed LLM (with a joint 4-bit quantization and 50% weight pruning compression) to match its uncompressed counterparts on popular benchmarks. We note that we are the first to reveal vanilla Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques have the potential to be utilized under a compression recovery context, opening a new line of opportunities for model accessibility advancement while freeing our fellow researchers from the previously present engineering burdens and constraints. The code is available at https://github.com/zirui-ray-liu/compress-then-prompt."}
{"title": "GliDe with a CaPE: A Low-Hassle Method to Accelerate Speculative Decoding", "abstract": "Speculative decoding is a relatively new decoding framework that leverages small and efficient draft models to reduce the latency of LLMs. In this study, we introduce GliDe and CaPE, two low-hassle modifications to vanilla speculative decoding to further improve the decoding speed of a frozen LLM. Specifically, GliDe is a modified draft model architecture that reuses the cached keys and values from the target LLM, while CaPE is a proposal expansion method that uses the draft model's confidence scores to help select additional candidate tokens for verification. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed GliDe draft model significantly reduces the expected decoding latency. Additional evaluation using walltime reveals that GliDe can accelerate Vicuna models up to 2.17x and further extend the improvement to 2.61x with CaPE. We will release our code, data, and the trained draft models."}
{"title": "LoRAP: Transformer Sub-Layers Deserve Differentiated Structured Compression for Large Language Models", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) show excellent performance in difficult tasks, but they often require massive memories and computational resources. How to reduce the parameter scale of LLMs has become research hotspots. In this study, we get an important observation that the multi-head self-attention (MHA) sub-layer of Transformer exhibits noticeable low-rank structure, while the feed-forward network (FFN) sub-layer does not. With this regard, we design a novel structured compression method LoRAP, which organically combines **Lo**w-**R**ank matrix approximation **A**nd structured **P**runing. For the MHA sub-layer, we proposal an input activation weighted singular value decomposition method and allocate different parameter amounts for each weight matrix based on the differences in low-rank properties of matrices.For the FFN sub-layer, we propose a gradient-free structured channel pruning method and save the least important 1% of parameters which actually play a vital role in model performance. Extensive evaluations on zero-shot perplexity and zero-shot task classification indicate that our proposal is superior to previous structured compression rivals under multiple compression ratios. Our code will be released soon."}
{"title": "Privacy-Preserving Instructions for Aligning Large Language Models", "abstract": "Service providers of large language model (LLM) applications collect user instructions in the wild and use them in further aligning LLMs with users' intentions. These instructions, which potentially contain sensitive information, are annotated by human workers in the process. This poses a new privacy risk not addressed by the typical private optimization. To this end, we propose using synthetic instructions to replace real instructions in data annotation and model fine-tuning. Formal differential privacy is guaranteed by generating those synthetic instructions using privately fine-tuned generators. Crucial in achieving the desired utility is our novel filtering algorithm that matches the distribution of the synthetic instructions to that of the real ones. In both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, our extensive experiments demonstrate the high utility of the final set of synthetic instructions by showing comparable results to real instructions. In supervised fine-tuning, models trained with private synthetic instructions outperform leading open-source models such as Vicuna."}
{"title": "WebLINX: Real-World Website Navigation with Multi-Turn Dialogue", "abstract": "We propose the problem of conversational web navigation, where a digital agent controls a web browser and follows user instructions to solve real-world tasks in a multi-turn dialogue fashion. To support this problem, we introduce WEBLINX - a large-scale benchmark of 100K interactions across 2300 expert demonstrations of conversational web navigation. Our benchmark covers a broad range of patterns on over 150 real-world websites and can be used to train and evaluate agents in diverse scenarios. Due to the magnitude of information present, Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot process entire web pages in real-time. To solve this bottleneck, we design a retrieval-inspired model that efficiently prunes HTML pages by ranking relevant elements. We use the selected elements, along with screenshots and action history, to assess a variety of models for their ability to replicate human behavior when navigating the web. Our experiments span from small text-only to proprietary multimodal LLMs. We find that smaller finetuned decoders surpass the best zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4V), but also larger finetuned multimodal models which were explicitly pretrained on screenshots. However, all finetuned models struggle to generalize to unseen websites. Our findings highlight the need for large multimodal models that can generalize to novel settings."}
{"title": "A Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent", "abstract": "This paper describes MAIA, a Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent. MAIA is a system that uses neural models to automate neural model understanding tasks like feature interpretation and failure mode discovery. It equips a pre-trained vision-language model with a set of tools that support iterative experimentation on subcomponents of other models to explain their behavior. These include tools commonly used by human interpretability researchers: for synthesizing and editing inputs, computing maximally activating exemplars from real-world datasets, and summarizing and describing experimental results. Interpretability experiments proposed by MAIA compose these tools to describe and explain system behavior. We evaluate applications of MAIA to computer vision models. We first characterize MAIA’s ability to describe (neuron-level) features in learned representations of images. Across several trained models and a novel dataset of synthetic vision neurons with paired ground-truth descriptions, MAIA produces descriptions comparable to those generated by expert human experimenters. We then show that MAIA can aid in two additional interpretability tasks: reducing sensitivity to spurious features, and automatically identifying inputs likely to be mis-classified."}
{"title": "Degeneration-free Policy Optimization: RL Fine-Tuning for Language Models without Degeneration", "abstract": "As the pre-training objectives (e.g., next token prediction) of language models (LMs) are inherently not aligned with task scores, optimizing LMs to achieve higher downstream task scores is essential. One of the promising approaches is to fine-tune LMs through reinforcement learning (RL). However, conventional RL methods based on PPO and a penalty of KL divergence are vulnerable to text degeneration where LMs do not generate natural texts anymore after RL fine-tuning. To address this problem, we provide Degeneration-free Policy Optimization (DfPO) that can fine-tune LMs to generate texts that achieve improved downstream task scores, while preserving the ability to generate natural texts. To achieve this, we introduce KL-masking which masks out the actions that potentially cause deviation from the reference policy when its likelihood is increased or decreased. Then, we devise truncated advantage functions for separately performing likelihood maximization and minimization to improve the task performance. In the experiments, we provide the results of DfPO and baseline algorithms on various generative NLP tasks including text continuation, text detoxification, and commonsense generation. Our experiments demonstrate that DfPO successfully improves the downstream task scores while preserving the ability to generate natural texts, without requiring additional hyperparameter search."}
{"title": "DistiLLM: Towards Streamlined Distillation for Large Language Models", "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is widely used for compressing a teacher model to a smaller student model, reducing its inference cost and memory footprint while preserving model capabilities. However, current KD methods for auto-regressive sequence models (e.g., large language models) suffer from missing a standardized objective function. Moreover, the recent use of student-generated outputs to address training-inference mismatches has significantly escalated computational costs. To tackle these issues, we introduce DistiLLM, a more effective and efficient KD framework for auto-regressive language models. DistiLLM comprises two components: (1) a novel skew Kullback-Leibler divergence loss, where we unveil and leverage its theoretical properties, and (2) an adaptive off-policy approach designed to enhance the efficiency in utilizing student-generated outputs. Extensive experiments, including instruction-following tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of DistiLLM in building high-performing student models while achieving up to 4.3$\\times$ speedup compared to recent KD methods."}
{"title": "Generalization to New Sequential Decision Making Tasks with In-Context Learning", "abstract": "Training autonomous agents that can learn new tasks from only a handful of demonstrations is a long-standing problem in machine learning. Recently, transformers have been shown to learn new language or vision tasks without any weight updates from only a few examples, also referred to as in-context learning. However, the sequential decision making setting poses additional challenges having a lower tolerance for errors since the environment's stochasticity or the agent's actions can lead to unseen, and sometimes unrecoverable, states. In this paper, we use an illustrative example to show that naively applying transformers to sequential decision making problems does not enable in-context learning of new tasks. We then demonstrate how training on sequences of trajectories with certain distributional properties leads to in-context learning of new sequential decision making tasks. We investigate different design choices and find that larger model and dataset sizes, as well as more task diversity, environment stochasticity, and trajectory burstiness, all result in better in-context learning of new out-of-distribution tasks. By training on large diverse offline datasets, our model is able to learn new MiniHack and Procgen tasks without any weight updates from just a handful of demonstrations."}
{"title": "Self-Alignment of Large Language Models via Monopolylogue-based Social Scene Simulation", "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is imperative to mitigate potential adverse effects resulting from their misuse. Drawing from the sociological insight that acknowledging all parties' concerns is a key factor in shaping human values, this paper proposes a novel direction to align LLMs by themselves: social scene simulation. To achieve this, we present MATRIX, a novel social scene simulator that emulates realistic scenes around a user's input query, enabling the LLM to take social consequences into account before responding. MATRIX serves as a virtual rehearsal space, akin to a Monopolylogue, where the LLM performs diverse roles related to the query and practice by itself. To inject this alignment, we fine-tune the LLM with MATRIX-simulated data, ensuring adherence to human values without compromising inference speed. We theoretically show that the LLM with MATRIX outperforms existing methods under mild assumptions. Finally, extensive experiments validate that our method outperforms over 10 baselines across 4 benchmarks. As evidenced by 875 user ratings, our tuned 13B-size LLM exceeds GPT-4 in aligning with human values. See our project page at https://shuotang123.github.io/MATRIX."}
{"title": "TravelPlanner: A Benchmark for Real-World Planning with Language Agents", "abstract": "Planning has been part of the core pursuit for artificial intelligence since its conception, but earlier AI agents mostly focused on constrained settings because many of the cognitive substrates necessary for human-level planning have been lacking. Recently, language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown interesting capabilities such as tool use and reasoning. Are these language agents capable of planning in more complex settings that are out of the reach of prior AI agents? To advance this investigation, we propose TravelPlanner, a new planning benchmark that focuses on travel planning, a common real-world planning scenario. It provides a rich sandbox environment, various tools for accessing nearly four million data records, and 1,225 meticulously curated planning intents and reference plans. Comprehensive evaluations show that the current language agents are not yet capable of handling such complex planning tasks—even GPT-4 only achieves a success rate of 0.6%. Language agents struggle to stay on task, use the right tools to collect information, or keep track of multiple constraints. However, we note that the mere possibility for language agents to tackle such a complex problem is in itself non-trivial progress. TravelPlanner provides a challenging yet meaningful testbed for future language agents."}
{"title": "BAT: Learning to Reason about Spatial Sounds with Large Language Models", "abstract": "Spatial sound reasoning is a fundamental human skill, enabling us to navigate and interpret our surroundings based on sound. In this paper we present BAT, which combines the spatial sound perception ability of a binaural acoustic scene analysis model with the natural language reasoning capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to replicate this innate ability. To address the lack of existing datasets of in-the-wild spatial sounds, we synthesized a binaural audio dataset using AudioSet and SoundSpaces 2.0. Next, we developed SpatialSoundQA, a spatial sound-based question-answering dataset, offering a range of QA tasks that train BAT in various aspects of spatial sound perception and reasoning. The acoustic front end encoder of BAT is a novel spatial audio encoder named Spatial Audio Spectrogram Transformer, or Spatial-AST, which by itself achieves strong performance across sound event detection, spatial localization, and distance estimation. By integrating Spatial-AST with LLaMA-2 7B model, BAT transcends standard Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) tasks, enabling the model to reason about the relationships between the sounds in its environment. Our experiments demonstrate BAT's superior performance on both spatial sound perception and reasoning, showcasing the immense potential of LLMs in navigating and interpreting complex spatial audio environments."}
{"title": "R2E: Turning any Github Repository into a Programming Agent Environment", "abstract": "While Large Language Models’ (LLMs) coding capabilities have advanced rapidly, corresponding evaluation benchmarks on real-world programming setups are yet to catch up. Building a scalable and interactive testbed for evaluating general-purpose AI coding agents for real-world code has been challenging, particularly due to a lack of high-quality test suites available. In this paper, we present Repository to Environment (R2E), a framework that can turn any GitHub repository into a test environment to evaluate the performance of code-generating systems, both static and interactive. R2E is powered by a synergistic combination of program analysis and LLMs to construct equivalence test harnesses for any GitHub function. We instantiate our framework to build the first large-scale benchmark, R2E-Eval1, for building realistic environments for AI coding assistants. Our results demonstrate that even when SOTA models cannot generate correct solutions with advanced prompting techniques, they can effectively use environment feedback highlighting the need to move from static functional coding to interactive programming paradigm. We hope that our framework (and the instantiated benchmark) can motivate research directions by providing web-scale open-ended coding environments. R2E code is available at https://r2e.dev/"}
{"title": "Fewer Truncations Improve Language Modeling", "abstract": "In large language model training, input documents are typically concatenated together and then split into sequences of equal length to avoid padding tokens. Despite its efficiency, the concatenation approach compromises data integrity—it inevitably breaks many documents into incomplete pieces, leading to excessive truncations that hinder the model from learning to compose logically coherent and factually consistent content that is grounded on the complete context. To address the issue, we propose Best-fit Packing, a scalable and efficient method that packs documents into training sequences through length-aware combinatorial optimization. Our method completely eliminates unnecessary truncations while retaining the same training efficiency as concatenation. Empirical results from both text and code pre-training show that our method achieves superior performance (e.g., +4.7% on reading comprehension; +16.8% in context following; and +9.2% on program synthesis), and reduces closed-domain hallucination effectively by up to 58.3%."}

We present a novel approach, referred to as **PPAE**, which serves as a general module for diffusion models and enables precise audio editing. The editing is based on the input textual prompt only and is entirely training-free. We exploit the cross-attention maps of diffusion models to facilitate accurate local editing and employ a hierarchical local-global pipeline to ensure a smoother editing process.

Additionally, we leverage masked prediction as the training objective, enabling the model to generalize to other tasks such as music infilling and continuation in a zero-shot manner. Experiments on MusicCaps reveal that the music generated by MusicFlow exhibits superior quality and text coherence despite being over $2\\sim5$ times smaller and requiring $5$ times fewer iterative steps. Simultaneously, the model can perform other music generation tasks and achieves competitive performance in music infilling and continuation."}
{"title": "Do Language Models Exhibit the Same Cognitive Biases in Problem Solving as Human Learners?", "abstract": "There is increasing interest in employing large language models (LLMs) as cognitive models. For such purposes, it is central to understand which properties of human cognition are well-modeled by LLMs, and which are not. In this work, we study the biases of LLMs in relation to those known in children when solving arithmetic word problems. Surveying the learning science literature, we posit that the problem-solving process can be split into three distinct steps: text comprehension, solution planning and solution execution. We construct tests for each one in order to understand whether current LLMs display the same cognitive biases as children in these steps. We generate a novel set of word problems for each of these tests, using a neuro-symbolic approach that enables fine-grained control over the problem features. We find evidence that LLMs, with and without instruction-tuning, exhibit human-like biases in both the text-comprehension and the solution-planning steps of the solving process, but not in the final step, in which the arithmetic expressions are executed to obtain the answer."}

Therefore, we advocate for the construction of foundation agents as a transformative shift in the learning paradigm of agents. This proposal is underpinned by the formulation of foundation agents with their fundamental characteristics and challenges motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs). Moreover, we specify the roadmap of foundation agents from large interactive data collection or generation, to self-supervised pretraining and adaptation, and knowledge and value alignment with LLMs. Lastly, we pinpoint critical research questions derived from the formulation and delineate trends for foundation agents supported by real-world use cases, addressing both technical and theoretical aspects to propel the field towards a more comprehensive and impactful future."}

{"title": "In-Context Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought", "abstract": "In-context learning is a promising approach for offline reinforcement learning (RL) to handle online tasks, which can be achieved by providing task prompts. Recent works demonstrated that in-context RL could emerge with self-improvement in a trial-and-error manner when treating RL tasks as an across-episodic sequential prediction problem. Despite the self-improvement not requiring gradient updates, current works still suffer from high computational costs when the across-episodic sequence increases with task horizons. To this end, we propose an In-context Decision Transformer (IDT) to achieve self-improvement in a high-level trial-and-error manner. Specifically, IDT is inspired by the efficient hierarchical structure of human decision-making and thus reconstructs the sequence to consist of high-level decisions instead of low-level actions that interact with environments. As one high-level decision can guide multi-step low-level actions, IDT naturally avoids excessively long sequences and solves online tasks more efficiently. Experimental results show that IDT achieves state-of-the-art in long-horizon tasks over current in-context RL methods. In particular, the online evaluation time of our IDT is 36$\\times$ times faster than baselines in the D4RL benchmark and 27$\\times$ times faster in the Grid World benchmark."}
{"title": "BBox-Adapter: Lightweight Adapting for Black-Box Large Language Models", "abstract": "Adapting state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini for specific tasks is challenging. Due to the opacity in their parameters, embeddings, and even output probabilities, existing fine-tuning adaptation methods are inapplicable. Consequently, adapting these black-box LLMs is only possible through their API services, raising concerns about transparency, privacy, and cost. To address these challenges, we introduce BBox-Adapter, a novel lightweight adapter for black-box LLMs. BBox-Adapter distinguishes target and source domain data by treating target data as positive and source data as negative. It employs a ranking-based Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss to promote the likelihood of target domain data while penalizing that of the source domain. Furthermore, it features an online adaptation mechanism, which incorporates real-time positive data sampling from ground-truth, human, or AI feedback, coupled with negative data from previous adaptations. Extensive experiments demonstrate BBox-Adapter's effectiveness and cost efficiency. It improves model performance by up to 6.77% across diverse tasks and domains, while reducing training and inference costs by 31.30x and 1.84x, respectively."}
{"title": "Connecting the Dots: Collaborative Fine-tuning for Black-Box Vision-Language Models", "abstract": "With the emergence of pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), considerable efforts have been devoted to fine-tuning them for downstream tasks. Despite the progress made in designing efficient fine-tuning methods, such methods require access to the model's parameters, which can be challenging as model owners often opt to provide their models as a black box to safeguard model ownership. This paper proposes a **C**ollabo**ra**tive **F**ine-**T**uning (**CraFT**) approach for fine-tuning black-box VLMs to downstream tasks, where one only has access to the input prompts and the output predictions of the model. CraFT comprises two modules, a prompt generation module for learning text prompts and a prediction refinement module for enhancing output predictions in residual style. Additionally, we introduce an auxiliary prediction-consistent loss to promote consistent optimization across these modules. These modules are optimized by a novel collaborative training algorithm. Extensive experiments on few-shot classification over 15 datasets demonstrate the superiority of CraFT. The results show that CraFT achieves a decent gain of about 12% with 16-shot datasets and only 8,000 queries. Moreover, CraFT trains faster and uses only about 1/80 of the memory footprint for deployment, while sacrificing only 1.62% compared to the white-box method.

{"title": "SyCoCa: Symmetrizing Contrastive Captioners with Attentive Masking for Multimodal Alignment", "abstract": "Multimodal alignment between language and vision is the fundamental topic in current vision-language model research. Contrastive Captioners (CoCa), as a representative method, integrates Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) and Image Caption (IC) into a unified framework, resulting in impressive results. CLIP imposes a bidirectional constraints on global representations of entire images and sentences. Although IC conducts an unidirectional image-to-text generation on local representation, it lacks any constraint on local text-to-image reconstruction, which limits the ability to understand images at a fine-grained level when aligned with texts. To achieve multimodal alignment from both global and local perspectives, this paper proposes Symmetrizing Contrastive Captioners (SyCoCa), which introduces bidirectional interactions on images and texts across the global and local representation levels. Specifically, we expand a Text-Guided Masked Image Modeling (TG-MIM) head based on ITC and IC heads. The improved SyCoCa further leverages textual cues to reconstruct contextual images and visual cues to predict textual contents. When implementing bidirectional local interactions, the local contents of images tend to be cluttered or unrelated to their textual descriptions. Thus, we employ an attentive masking strategy to select effective image patches for interaction. Extensive experiments on five vision-language tasks, including image-text retrieval, image-captioning, visual question answering, and zero-shot/finetuned image classification, validate the effectiveness of our proposed method."}

Open foundation models present significant benefits, with some caveats, that span innovation, competition, the distribution of decision-making power, and transparency. To understand their risks of misuse, we design a risk assessment framework for analyzing their *marginal risk*. Across several misuse vectors (e.g., cyberattacks, bioweapons), we find that current research is insufficient to effectively characterize the marginal risk of open foundation models relative to pre-existing technologies. The framework helps explain why the marginal risk is low in some cases, clarifies disagreements about misuse risks by revealing that past work has focused on different subsets of the framework with different assumptions, and articulates a way forward for more constructive debate. Overall, our work helps support a more grounded assessment of the societal impact of open foundation models by outlining what research is needed to empirically validate their theoretical benefits and risks."}
{"title": "Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention", "abstract": "The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to obtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade and even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a novel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate through information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two technologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1) statistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized parameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2) finetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic representation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive experiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA and LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4-bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4% improvement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant performance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption, revealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that IR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks (e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.

{"title": "BetterV: Controlled Verilog Generation with Discriminative Guidance", "abstract": "Due to the growing complexity of modern Integrated Circuits (ICs), there is a need for automated circuit design methods. Recent years have seen increasing research in hardware design language generation to facilitate the design process. In this work, we propose a Verilog generation framework, BetterV, which fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) on processed domain-specific datasets and incorporates generative discriminators for guidance on particular design demands. Verilog modules are collected, filtered, and processed from the internet to form a clean and abundant dataset. Instruct-tuning methods are specially designed to fine-tune the LLMs to understand knowledge about Verilog. Furthermore, data are augmented to enrich the training set and are also used to train a generative discriminator on particular downstream tasks, providing guidance for the LLMs to optimize Verilog implementation. BetterV has the ability to generate syntactically and functionally correct Verilog, outperforming GPT-4 on the VerilogEval benchmark. With the help of task-specific generative discriminators, BetterV achieves remarkable improvements on various electronic design automation (EDA) downstream tasks, including netlist node reduction for synthesis and verification runtime reduction with Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solving."}

This benchmark focuses on syntax-aware completions of program structures such as code blocks and conditional expressions, and includes 17,720 examples from multiple programming languages, sourced from recent code submissions after April 2022 to minimize data contamination. SAFIM provides a robust framework with various prompt designs and novel syntax-aware post-processing techniques, facilitating accurate and fair comparisons across LLMs. Our comprehensive evaluation of 15 LLMs shows that FIM pretraining not only enhances FIM proficiency but also improves Left-to-Right (L2R) inference using LLMs. Our findings challenge conventional beliefs and suggest that pretraining methods and data quality have more impact than model size. SAFIM thus serves as a foundational platform for future research in effective pretraining strategies for code LLMs. The evaluation toolkit and dataset are available at https://github.com/gonglinyuan/safim, and the leaderboard is available at https://safimbenchmark.com."}
{"title": "Executable Code Actions Elicit Better LLM Agents", "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents, capable of performing a broad range of actions, such as invoking tools and controlling robots, show great potential in tackling real-world challenges. LLM agents are typically prompted to produce actions by generating JSON or text in a pre-defined format, which is usually limited by constrained action space (e.g., the scope of pre-defined tools) and restricted flexibility (e.g., inability to compose multiple tools). This work proposes to use executable Python **code** to consolidate LLM agents' **act**ions into a unified action space (**CodeAct**). Integrated with a Python interpreter, CodeAct can execute code actions and dynamically revise prior actions or emit new actions upon new observations through multi-turn interactions. Our extensive analysis of 17 LLMs on API-Bank and a newly curated benchmark shows that CodeAct outperforms widely used alternatives (up to 20% higher success rate). The encouraging performance of CodeAct motivates us to build an open-source LLM agent that interacts with environments by executing interpretable code and collaborates with users using natural language. To this end, we collect an instruction-tuning dataset CodeActInstruct that consists of 7k multi-turn interactions using CodeAct. We show that it can be used with existing data to improve models in agent-oriented tasks without compromising their general capability. CodeActAgent, finetuned from Llama2 and Mistral, is integrated with Python interpreter and uniquely tailored to perform sophisticated tasks (e.g., model training) using existing libraries and autonomously self-debug."}
{"title": "Position: Fundamental Limitations of LLM Censorship Necessitate New Approaches", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in comprehending complex instructions. However, their blind adherence to provided instructions has led to concerns regarding risks of malicious use. Existing defence mechanisms, such as model fine-tuning or output censorship methods have proven to be fallible at ensuring that LLMs do not return semantically impermissible responses. We present fundamental limitations of verifying the semantic properties of LLM outputs and identifying compositional threats, illustrating inherent challenges of current approaches to censoring LLM outputs. Specifically, we demonstrate that semantic censorship can be perceived as an undecidable problem, and semantic properties of LLM outputs can become impossible to verify when the LLM is capable of providing \"encrypted\" outputs. We further show challenges of censorship can extend beyond just semantic censorship, as attackers can reconstruct impermissible outputs from a collection of permissible ones. Consequently, we call for a re-evaluation of the problem of censorship and its goals, stressing the need for new definitions and approaches to censorship. In addition, we provide an initial attempt toward achieving this goal through syntactic censorship, drawing from a security perspective to design censorship methods that can provide guarantees."}
{"title": "AI Alignment with Changing and Influenceable Reward Functions", "abstract": "Existing AI alignment approaches assume that preferences are static, which is unrealistic: our preferences change, and may even be influenced by our interactions with AI systems themselves. To clarify the consequences of incorrectly assuming static preferences, we introduce Dynamic Reward Markov Decision Processes (DR-MDPs), which explicitly model preference changes and the AI's influence on them. We show that despite its convenience, the static-preference assumption may undermine the soundness of existing alignment techniques, leading them to implicitly reward AI systems for influencing user preferences in ways users may not truly want. We then explore potential solutions. First, we offer a unifying perspective on how an agent's optimization horizon may partially help reduce undesirable AI influence. Then, we formalize different notions of AI alignment that account for preference change from the outset. Comparing the strengths and limitations of 8 such notions of alignment, we find that they all either err towards causing undesirable AI influence, or are overly risk-averse, suggesting that a straightforward solution to the problems of changing preferences may not exist. As there is no avoiding grappling with changing preferences in real-world settings, this makes it all the more important to handle these issues with care, balancing risks and capabilities. We hope our work can provide conceptual clarity and constitute a first step towards AI alignment practices which explicitly account for (and contend with) the changing and influenceable nature of human preferences."}
{"title": "Position: What Can Large Language Models Tell Us about Time Series Analysis", "abstract": "Time series analysis is essential for comprehending the complexities inherent in various real-world systems and applications. Although large language models (LLMs) have recently made significant strides, the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) equipped with time series analysis capabilities remains in its nascent phase. Most existing time series models heavily rely on domain knowledge and extensive model tuning, predominantly focusing on prediction tasks. In this paper, we argue that current LLMs have the potential to revolutionize time series analysis, thereby promoting efficient decision-making and advancing towards a more universal form of time series analytical intelligence. Such advancement could unlock a wide range of possibilities, including time series modality switching and question answering. We encourage researchers and practitioners to recognize the potential of LLMs in advancing time series analysis and emphasize the need for trust in these related efforts. Furthermore, we detail the seamless integration of time series analysis with existing LLM technologies and outline promising avenues for future research."}

Existing model families, like variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), autoregressive models, and (latent) diffusion models, generally excel in specific capabilities and data types but fall short in others. We introduce *Generalized* ***E****ncoding*-***D****ecoding ****D****iffusion ****P****robabilistic ****M****odels* (EDDPMs) which integrate the core capabilities for broad applicability and enhanced performance. EDDPMs generalize the Gaussian noising-denoising in standard diffusion by introducing parameterized encoding-decoding. Crucially, EDDPMs are compatible with the well-established diffusion model objective and training recipes, allowing effective learning of the encoder-decoder parameters *jointly* with diffusion. By choosing appropriate encoder/decoder (e.g., large language models), EDDPMs naturally apply to different data types. Extensive experiments on text, proteins, and images demonstrate the flexibility to handle diverse data and tasks and the strong improvement over various existing models.

{"title": "Evaluating Model Bias Requires Characterizing its Mistakes", "abstract": "The ability to properly benchmark model performance in the face of spurious correlations is important to both build better predictors and increase confidence that models are operating as intended. We demonstrate that characterizing (as opposed to simply quantifying) model mistakes across subgroups is pivotal to properly reflect model biases, which are ignored by standard metrics such as worst-group accuracy or accuracy gap. Inspired by the hypothesis testing framework, we introduce SkewSize, a principled and flexible metric that captures bias from mistakes in a model's predictions. It can be used in multi-class settings or generalised to the open vocabulary setting of generative models. SkewSize is an aggregation of the effect size of the interaction between two categorical variables: the spurious variable representing the bias attribute the model's prediction. We demonstrate the utility of SkewSize in multiple settings including: standard vision models trained on synthetic data, vision models trained on ImageNet, and large scale vision-and-language models from the BLIP-2 family. In each case, the proposed SkewSize is able to highlight biases not captured by other metrics, while also providing insights on the impact of recently proposed techniques, such as instruction tuning."}

Contrastive Language Pretraining (CLIP) on the other hand, works by mapping an image and its caption to a single vector -- limiting how well CLIP-like models can represent the diverse ways to describe an image. In this work, we introduce Llip, Latent Language Image Pretraining, which models the diversity of captions that could match an image. Llip's vision encoder outputs a set of visual features that are mixed into a final representation by conditioning on information derived from the text. We show that Llip outperforms non-contextualized baselines like CLIP and SigLIP on a variety of tasks even with large-scale encoders. Llip improves zero-shot classification by an average of 2.9% zero-shot classification benchmarks with a ViT-G/14 encoder. Specifically, Llip attains a zero-shot top-1 accuracy of 83.5% on ImageNet outperforming a similarly sized CLIP by 1.4%. We also demonstrate improvement on zero-shot retrieval on MS-COCO by 6.0%. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the components introduced by the method and demonstrate that Llip leads to richer visual representations."}
{"title": "Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization", "abstract": "Kahneman & Tversky's $\\textit{prospect theory}$ tells us that humans perceive random variables in a biased but well-defined manner (1992); for example, humans are famously loss-averse. We show that objectives for aligning LLMs with human feedback implicitly incorporate many of these biases---the success of these objectives (e.g., DPO) over cross-entropy minimization can partly be ascribed to them belonging to a family of loss functions that we call $\\textit{human-aware losses}$ (HALOs). However, the utility functions these methods attribute to humans still differ from those in the prospect theory literature. Using a Kahneman-Tversky model of human utility, we propose a HALO that directly maximizes the utility of generations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood of preferences, as current methods do. We call this approach KTO, and it matches or exceeds the performance of preference-based methods at scales from 1B to 30B, despite only learning from a binary signal of whether an output is desirable. More broadly, our work suggests that there is no one HALO that is universally superior; the best loss depends on the inductive biases most appropriate for a given setting, an oft-overlooked consideration."}
{"title": "Debating with More Persuasive LLMs Leads to More Truthful Answers", "abstract": "Common methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) with desired behaviour heavily rely on human-labelled data. However, as models grow increasingly sophisticated, they will surpass human expertise, and the role of human evaluation will evolve into non-experts overseeing experts. In anticipation of this, we ask: can weaker models assess the correctness of stronger models? We investigate this question in an analogous setting, where stronger models (experts) possess the necessary information to answer questions and weaker models (non-experts) lack this information. The method we evaluate is *debate*, where two LLM experts each argue for a different answer, and a non-expert selects the answer. We find that debate consistently helps both non-expert models and humans answer questions, achieving 76% and 88% accuracy respectively (naive baselines obtain 48% and 60%). Furthermore, optimising expert debaters for persuasiveness in an unsupervised manner improves non-expert ability to identify the truth in debates. Our results provide encouraging empirical evidence for the viability of aligning models with debate in the absence of ground truth."}
{"title": "Learning from Students: Applying t-Distributions to Explore Accurate and Efficient Formats for LLMs", "abstract": "The increasing size of large language models (LLMs) traditionally requires low-precision integer formats to meet strict latency and power demands. Yet recently, alternative formats such as Normal Float (NF4) have increased model accuracy at the cost of increased chip area. In this work, we first conduct a large-scale analysis of LLM weights and activations across 30 networks and conclude that most distributions follow a Student's t-distribution. We then derive a new theoretically optimal format, Student Float (SF4), that improves over NF4 across modern LLMs, for example increasing the average accuracy on LLaMA2-7B by 0.76% across tasks. Using this format as a high-accuracy reference, we then propose augmenting E2M1 with two variants of *supernormal* support for higher model accuracy. Finally, we explore the quality and efficiency frontier across 11 datatypes by evaluating their model accuracy and hardware complexity. We discover a Pareto curve composed of INT4, E2M1, and E2M1 with supernormal support, which offers a continuous tradeoff between model accuracy and chip area. For example, E2M1 with supernormal support increases the accuracy of Phi-2 by up to 2.19% with 1.22% area overhead, enabling more LLM-based applications to be run at four bits.

{"title": "Auto-Regressive Next-Token Predictors are Universal Learners", "abstract": "Large language models display remarkable capabilities in logical and mathematical reasoning, allowing them to solve complex tasks. Interestingly, these abilities emerge in networks trained on the simple task of next-token prediction. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for studying auto-regressive next-token predictors. We demonstrate that even simple models such as linear next-token predictors, trained on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, can approximate any function efficiently computed by a Turing machine. We introduce a new complexity measure---length complexity---which measures the number of intermediate tokens in a CoT sequence required to approximate some target function, and analyze the interplay between length complexity and other notions of complexity. Finally, we show experimentally that simple next-token predictors, such as linear networks and shallow Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), display non-trivial performance on text generation and arithmetic tasks. Our results demonstrate that the power of today's LLMs can be attributed, to a great extent, to the auto-regressive next-token training scheme, and not necessarily to a particular choice of architecture."}
{"title": "Self-Correcting Self-Consuming Loops for Generative Model Training", "abstract": "As synthetic data becomes higher quality and proliferates on the internet, machine learning models are increasingly trained on a mix of human- and machine-generated data. Despite the successful stories of using synthetic data for representation learning, using synthetic data for generative model training creates ``self-consuming loops'' which may lead to training instability or even collapse, unless certain conditions are met. Our paper aims to stabilize self-consuming generative model training. Our theoretical results demonstrate that by introducing an idealized correction function, which maps a data point to be more likely under the true data distribution, self-consuming loops can be made *exponentially* more stable. We then propose self-correction functions, which rely on expert knowledge (e.g. the laws of physics programmed in a simulator), and aim to approximate the idealized corrector automatically and at scale. We empirically validate the effectiveness of self-correcting self-consuming loops on the challenging human motion synthesis task, and observe that it successfully avoids model collapse, even when the ratio of synthetic data to real data is as high as 100%."}
{"title": "LLM and Simulation as Bilevel Optimizers: A New Paradigm to Advance Physical Scientific Discovery", "abstract": "Large Language Models have recently gained significant attention in scientific discovery for their extensive knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities. However, they encounter challenges in effectively simulating observational feedback and grounding it with language to propel advancements in physical scientific discovery. Conversely, human scientists undertake scientific discovery by formulating hypotheses, conducting experiments, and revising theories through observational analysis. Inspired by this, we propose to enhance the knowledge-driven, abstract reasoning abilities of LLMs with the computational strength of simulations. We introduce Scientific Generative Agent (SGA), a bilevel optimization framework: LLMs act as knowledgeable and versatile thinkers, proposing scientific hypotheses and reason about discrete components, such as physics equations or molecule structures; meanwhile, simulations function as experimental platforms, providing observational feedback and optimizing via differentiability for continuous parts, such as physical parameters. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate our framework's efficacy in constitutive law discovery and molecular design, unveiling novel solutions that differ from conventional human expectations yet remain coherent upon analysis."}
{"title": "Prompt-tuning Latent Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems", "abstract": "We propose a new method for solving imaging inverse problems using text-to-image latent diffusion models as general priors. Existing methods using latent diffusion models for inverse problems typically rely on simple null text prompts, which can lead to suboptimal performance. To improve upon this, we introduce a method for prompt tuning, which jointly optimizes the text embedding on-the-fly while running the reverse diffusion. This allows us to generate images that are more faithful to the diffusion prior. Specifically, our approach involves a unified optimization framework that simultaneously considers the prompt, latent, and pixel values through alternating minimization. This significantly diminishes image artifacts - a major problem when using latent diffusion models instead of pixel-based diffusion ones. Our method, called P2L, outperforms both pixel- and latent-diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers on a variety of tasks, such as super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting. Furthermore, P2L demonstrates remarkable scalability to higher resolutions without artifacts."}
{"title": "Behavior Generation with Latent Actions", "abstract": "Generative modeling of complex behaviors from labeled datasets has been a longstanding problem in decision-making. Unlike language or image generation, decision-making requires modeling actions – continuous-valued vectors that are multimodal in their distribution, potentially drawn from uncurated sources, where generation errors can compound in sequential prediction. A recent class of models called Behavior Transformers (BeT) addresses this by discretizing actions using k-means clustering to capture different modes. However, k-means struggles to scale for high-dimensional action spaces or long sequences, and lacks gradient information, and thus BeT suffers in modeling long-range actions. In this work, we present Vector-Quantized Behavior Transformer (VQ-BeT), a versatile model for behavior generation that handles multimodal action prediction, conditional generation, and partial observations. VQ-BeT augments BeT by tokenizing continuous actions with a hierarchical vector quantization module. Across seven environments including simulated manipulation, autonomous driving, and robotics, VQ-BeT improves on state-of-the-art models such as BeT and Diffusion Policies. Importantly, we demonstrate VQ-BeT’s improved ability to capture behavior modes while accelerating inference speed 5× over Diffusion Policies. Videos can be found https://sjlee.cc/vq-bet/"}
{"title": "ExCP: Extreme LLM Checkpoint Compression via Weight-Momentum Joint Shrinking", "abstract": "Large language models (LLM) have recently attracted significant attention in the field of artificial intelligence. However, the training process of these models poses significant challenges in terms of computational and storage capacities, thus compressing checkpoints has become an urgent problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Extreme Checkpoint Compression (ExCP) framework, which significantly reduces the required storage of training checkpoints while achieving nearly lossless performance. We first calculate the residuals of adjacent checkpoints to obtain the essential but sparse information for higher compression ratio. To further excavate the redundancy parameters in checkpoints, we then propose a weight-momentum joint shrinking method to utilize another important information during the model optimization, i.e., momentum. In particular, we exploit the information of both model and optimizer to discard as many parameters as possible while preserving critical information to ensure optimal performance. Furthermore, we utilize non-uniform quantization to further compress the storage of checkpoints. We extensively evaluate our proposed ExCP framework on several models ranging from 410M to 7B parameters and demonstrate significant storage reduction while maintaining strong performance. For instance, we achieve approximately $70\\times$ compression for the Pythia-410M model, with the final performance being as accurate as the original model on various downstream tasks. Codes will be available at https://github.com/Gaffey/ExCP."}

The European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) is an exemplary policy response addressing these harms generated by online platforms. In this regard, it necessitates a comprehensive evaluation of its impact on curbing the harmful downstream effects of these opaque practices. Despite their harmful applications, we argue that machine learning techniques offer immense, yet under-exploited, potential for unraveling the impacts of regulations like the DSA. Following an analysis that reveals possible limitations in the DSA's provisions, we call for resolute efforts to address methodological barriers around appropriate data access, isolating marginal regulatory effects, and facilitating generalization across different contexts. Given the identified advantages of data-driven approaches to regulatory delivery, we advocate for machine learning research to help quantify the policy impacts on online harms."}
{"title": "Referee Can Play: An Alternative Approach to Conditional Generation via Model Inversion", "abstract": "As a dominant force in text-to-image generation tasks, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) face a critical challenge in controllability, struggling to adhere strictly to complex, multi-faceted instructions. In this work, we aim to address this alignment challenge for conditional generation tasks. First, we provide an alternative view of state-of-the-art DPMs as a way of inverting advanced Vision-Language Models (VLMs). With this formulation, we naturally propose a training-free approach that bypasses the conventional sampling process associated with DPMs. By directly optimizing images with the supervision of discriminative VLMs, the proposed method can potentially achieve a better text-image alignment. As proof of concept, we demonstrate the pipeline with the pre-trained BLIP-2 model and identify several key designs for improved image generation. To further enhance the image fidelity, a Score Distillation Sampling module of Stable Diffusion is incorporated. By carefully balancing the two components during optimization, our method can produce high-quality images with near state-of-the-art performance on T2I-Compbench.

{"title": "GaLore: Memory-Efficient LLM Training by Gradient Low-Rank Projection", "abstract": "Training Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant memory challenges, predominantly due to the growing size of weights and optimizer states. Common memory-reduction approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), add a trainable low-rank matrix to the frozen pre-trained weight in each layer, reducing trainable parameters and optimizer states. However, such approaches typically underperform training with full-rank weights in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages since they limit the parameter search to a low-rank subspace and alter the training dynamics, and further, may require full-rank warm start. In this work, we propose Gradient Low-Rank Projection (GaLore), a training strategy that allows full-parameter learning but is more memory-efficient than common low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA. Our approach reduces memory usage by up to 65.5% in optimizer states while maintaining both efficiency and performance for pre-training on LLaMA 1B and 7B architectures with C4 dataset with up to 19.7B tokens, and on fine-tuning RoBERTa on GLUE tasks. Our 8-bit GaLore further reduces optimizer memory by up to 82.5% and total training memory by 63.3%, compared to a BF16 baseline. Notably, we demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility of pre-training a 7B model on consumer GPUs with 24GB memory (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) without model parallel, checkpointing, or offloading strategies."}
{"title": "Progressive Inference: Explaining Decoder-Only Sequence Classification Models Using Intermediate Predictions", "abstract": "This paper proposes Progressive inference--a framework to explain the predictions of decoder-only transformer models trained to perform sequence classification tasks. Our work is based on the insight that the classification head of a decoder-only model can be used to make intermediate predictions by evaluating them at different points in the input sequence. Due to the masked attention mechanism used in decoder-only models, these intermediate predictions only depend on the tokens seen before the inference point, allowing us to obtain the model's prediction on a masked input sub-sequence, with negligible computational overheads. We develop two methods to provide sub-sequence level attributions using this core insight. First, we propose Single Pass-Progressive Inference (SP-PI) to compute attributions by simply taking the difference between intermediate predictions. Second, we exploit a connection with Kernel SHAP to develop Multi Pass-Progressive Inference (MP-PI); this uses intermediate predictions from multiple masked versions of the input to compute higher-quality attributions that approximate SHAP values. We perform studies on several text classification datasets to demonstrate that our proposal provides better explanations compared to prior work, both in the single-pass and multi-pass settings."}

However, there is limited theoretical justification for this phenomenon. Additionally, most recent studies focus on value-based algorithms despite the recent empirical successes of policy-based algorithms. In this work, we consider an RLHF algorithm based on policy optimization (PO-RLHF). The algorithm is based on the popular Policy Cover-Policy Gradient (PC-PG) algorithm, which assumes knowledge of the reward function. In PO-RLHF, knowledge of the reward function is not assumed and the algorithm relies on trajectory-based comparison feedback to infer the reward function. We provide performance bounds for PO-RLHF with low query complexity, which provides insight into why a small amount of human feedback may be sufficient to get good performance with RLHF. A key novelty is our trajectory-level elliptical potential analysis technique used to infer reward function parameters when comparison queries rather than reward observations are used. We provide and analyze algorithms in two settings: linear and neural function approximation, PG-RLHF and NN-PG-RLHF, respectively."}
{"title": "Q-Probe: A Lightweight Approach to Reward Maximization for Language Models", "abstract": "We present an approach called Q-probing to adapt a pre-trained language model to maximize a task-specific reward function. At a high level, Q-probing sits between heavier approaches such as finetuning and lighter approaches such as few shot prompting, but can also be combined with either. The idea is to learn a simple linear function on a model's embedding space that can be used to reweight candidate completions. We theoretically show that this sampling procedure is equivalent to a KL-constrained maximization of the Q-probe as the number of samples increases. To train the Q-probes we consider either reward modeling or a class of novel direct policy learning objectives based on importance-weighted policy gradients. With this technique, we see gains in domains with ground-truth rewards (code generation) as well as implicit rewards defined by preference data, even outperforming finetuning in data-limited regimes. Moreover, a Q-probe can be trained on top of an API since it only assumes access to sampling and embeddings. Code: [https://github.com/likenneth/q_probe](https://github.com/likenneth/q_probe)."}
{"title": "Generalized Preference Optimization: A Unified Approach to Offline Alignment", "abstract": "Offline preference optimization allows fine-tuning large models directly from offline data, and has proved effective in recent alignment practices. We propose generalized preference optimization (GPO), a family of offline losses parameterized by a general class of convex functions. GPO enables a unified view over preference optimization, encompassing existing algorithms such as DPO, IPO and SLiC as special cases, while naturally introducing new variants. The GPO framework also sheds light on how offline algorithms enforce regularization, through the design of the convex function that defines the loss. Our analysis and experiments reveal the connections and subtle differences between the offline regularization and the KL divergence regularization intended by the canonical RLHF formulation. In a controlled setting akin to Gao et al 2023, we also show that different GPO variants achieve similar trade-offs between regularization and performance, though the optimal values of hyper-parameter might differ as predicted by theory. In all, our results present new algorithmic toolkits and empirical insights to alignment practitioners."}

In this paper, we propose StackSight, a novel neurosymbolic approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced program analysis to decompile complex WebAssembly code into readable C++ snippets. StackSight visualizes and tracks virtual stack alterations via a static analysis algorithm and then applies chain-of-thought prompting to harness LLM's complex reasoning capabilities. Evaluation results show that StackSight significantly improves WebAssembly decompilation. Our user study also demonstrates that code snippets generated by StackSight have significantly higher win rates and enable a better grasp of code semantics."}

Our theoretical findings further enable the design of novel principled solutions applicable to state-of-the-art LLMs. First, we show that, through our geometric understanding, we can bypass LLMs' RLHF protection by controlling the embedding's intrinsic dimension through informed prompt manipulation. Second, we derive interpretable geometrical features that can be extracted from any (pre-trained) LLM, providing a rich abstract representation of their inputs. We observe that these features are sufficient to help solve toxicity detection, and even allow the identification of various types of toxicity.

Capable of interpreting open-world concepts in the hidden embeddings, SelfIE reveals LLM internal reasoning in cases such as making ethical decisions, internalizing prompt injection, and recalling harmful knowledge. SelfIE’s text descriptions on hidden embeddings open avenues to control LLM reasoning. We propose Supervised Control, which allows editing open-ended concepts while only requiring gradient computation of individual layer. We extend RLHF to hidden embeddings and propose Reinforcement Control that erases harmful knowledge in LLM without supervision targets."}
{"title": "Can AI Assistants Know What They Don't Know?", "abstract": "AI assistants powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various tasks. However, LLMs still make factual errors in knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain question answering. These untruthful responses from AI assistants can pose significant risks in practical applications. Therefore, in this paper, we ask the question **Can AI assistants know what they don't know and express this awareness through natural language?** To investigate this, we construct a model-specific \"I don't know\" (Idk) dataset. This dataset includes Supervised Fine-tuning data and preference data, categorizing questions based on whether the assistant knows or does not know the answers. Then, we align the assistant with its corresponding Idk dataset using different alignment methods, including Supervised Fine-tuning and preference optimization. Experimental results show that, after alignment with the Idk dataset, the assistant is more capable of declining to answer questions outside its knowledge scope. The assistant aligned with the Idk dataset shows significantly higher truthfulness than the original assistant."}
{"title": "Position: A Roadmap to Pluralistic Alignment", "abstract": "With increased power and prevalence of AI systems, it is ever more critical that AI systems are designed to serve *all*, i.e., people with diverse values and perspectives. However, aligning models to serve *pluralistic* human values remains an open research question. In this piece, we propose a roadmap to pluralistic alignment, specifically using large language models as a test bed. We identify and formalize three possible ways to define and operationalize pluralism in AI systems: 1) *Overton pluralistic* models that present a spectrum of reasonable responses; 2) *Steerably pluralistic* models that can steer to reflect certain perspectives; and 3) *Distributionally pluralistic* models that are well-calibrated to a given population in distribution. We also formalize and discuss three possible classes of *pluralistic benchmarks*: 1) *Multi-objective* benchmarks, 2) *Trade-off steerable* benchmarks that incentivize models to steer to arbitrary trade-offs, and 3) *Jury-pluralistic* benchmarks that explicitly model diverse human ratings. We use this framework to argue that current alignment techniques may be fundamentally limited for pluralistic AI; indeed, we highlight empirical evidence, both from our own experiments and from other work, that standard alignment procedures might *reduce* distributional pluralism in models, motivating the need for further research on pluralistic alignment."}
{"title": "SceneCraft: An LLM Agent for Synthesizing 3D Scenes as Blender Code", "abstract": "This paper introduces SceneCraft, a Large Language Model (LLM) Agent converting text descriptions into Blender-executable Python scripts which render complex scenes with up to a hundred 3D assets. This process requires complex spatial planning and arrangement. We tackle these challenges through a combination of advanced abstraction, strategic planning, and library learning. SceneCraft first models a scene graph as a blueprint, detailing the spatial relationships among assets in the scene. SceneCraft then writes Python scripts based on this graph, translating relationships into numerical constraints for asset layout. Next, SceneCraft leverages the perceptual strengths of vision-language foundation models like GPT-V to analyze rendered images and iteratively refine the scene. On top of this process, SceneCraft features a library learning mechanism that compiles common script functions into a reusable library, facilitating continuous self-improvement without expensive LLM parameter tuning. Our evaluation demonstrates that SceneCraft surpasses existing LLM-based agents in rendering complex scenes, as shown by its adherence to constraints and favorable human assessments. We also showcase the broader application potential of SceneCraft by reconstructing detailed 3D scenes from the Sintel movie and guiding a video generative model with generated scenes as intermediary control signal."}
{"title": "SLEB: Streamlining LLMs through Redundancy Verification and Elimination of Transformer Blocks", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be highly effective across various natural language processing tasks. However, their large number of parameters poses significant challenges for practical deployment. Pruning, a technique aimed at reducing the size and complexity of LLMs, offers a potential solution by removing redundant components from the network. Despite the promise of pruning, existing methods often struggle to achieve substantial end-to-end LLM inference speedup. In this paper, we introduce SLEB, a novel approach designed to stream- line LLMs by eliminating redundant transformer blocks. We choose the transformer block as the fundamental unit for pruning, because LLMs exhibit block-level redundancy with high similarity between the outputs of neighboring blocks. This choice allows us to effectively enhance the processing speed of LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that SLEB outperforms previous LLM pruning methods in accelerating LLM inference while also maintaining superior perplexity and accuracy, making SLEB as a promising technique for enhancing the efficiency of LLMs. The code is available at: https://github.com/jiwonsong-dev/SLEB."}
{"title": "Probabilistic Inference in Language Models via Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo", "abstract": "Numerous capability and safety techniques of Large Language Models (LLMs), including RLHF, automated red-teaming, prompt engineering, and infilling, can be cast as sampling from an unnormalized target distribution defined by a given reward or potential function over the full sequence. In this work, we leverage the rich toolkit of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for these probabilistic inference problems. In particular, we use learned twist functions to estimate the expected future value of the potential at each timestep, which enables us to focus inference-time computation on promising partial sequences. We propose a novel contrastive method for learning the twist functions, and establish connections with the rich literature of soft reinforcement learning. As a complementary application of our twisted SMC framework, we present methods for evaluating the accuracy of language model inference techniques using novel bidirectional SMC bounds on the log partition function. These bounds can be used to estimate the KL divergence between the inference and target distributions in both directions. We apply our inference evaluation techniques to show that twisted SMC is effective for sampling undesirable outputs from a pretrained model (a useful component of harmlessness training and automated red-teaming), generating reviews with varied sentiment, and performing infilling tasks."}
{"title": "Differentially Private Bias-Term Fine-tuning of Foundation Models", "abstract": "We study the problem of differentially private (DP) fine-tuning of large pre-trained models — a recent privacy-preserving approach suitable for solving downstream tasks with sensitive data. Existing work has demonstrated that high accuracy is possible under strong privacy constraint, yet requires significant computational overhead or modifications to the network architecture. We propose differentially private bias-term fine-tuning (DP-BiTFiT), which matches the state-of-the-art accuracy for DP algorithms and the efficiency of the standard BiTFiT. DP-BiTFiT is model agnostic (not modifying the network architecture), parameter efficient (only training about 0.1% of the parameters), and computation efficient (almost removing the overhead caused by DP, in both the time and space complexity). On a wide range of tasks, DP-BiTFiT is 2 - 30X faster and uses 2 - 8X less memory than DP full fine-tuning, even faster than the standard full fine-tuning. This amazing efficiency enables us to conduct DP fine-tuning on language and vision tasks with long-sequence texts and high-resolution images, which were computationally difficult using existing methods."}
{"title": "Language Models are Super Mario: Absorbing Abilities from Homologous Models as a Free Lunch", "abstract": "In this paper, we unveil that Language Models (LMs) can acquire new capabilities by assimilating parameters from homologous models without retraining or GPUs. We first introduce DARE to set most delta parameters (i.e., the disparity between fine-tuned and pre-trained parameters) to zeros without affecting the abilities of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) LMs, which randomly **D**rops delta parameters with a ratio $p$ **A**nd **RE**scales the remaining ones by $1 / (1 - p)$ to approximate the original embeddings. Then, we use DARE as a versatile plug-in to sparsify delta parameters of multiple SFT homologous models for mitigating parameter interference and merge them into a single model by parameter fusing. We experiment with encoder- and decoder-based LMs, showing that: (1) SFT delta parameter value ranges are typically small (within 0.002) with extreme redundancy, and DARE can effortlessly eliminate 90% or even 99% of them; (2) DARE can merge multiple task-specific LMs into one LM with diverse capabilities. Notably, this phenomenon is more pronounced in large-scale LMs, where the merged LM reveals the potential to surpass the performance of any source LM, providing a new discovery. We also utilize DARE to create a merged LM that ranks first among models with 7 billion parameters on the Open LLM Leaderboard."}
{"title": "MAGDi: Structured Distillation of Multi-Agent Interaction Graphs Improves Reasoning in Smaller Language Models", "abstract": "Multi-agent interactions between Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown major improvements on diverse reasoning tasks. However, these involve long generations from multiple models across several rounds, making them expensive. Moreover, these multi-agent approaches fail to provide a final, single model for efficient inference. To address this, we introduce MAGDi, a new method for structured distillation of the reasoning interactions between multiple LLMs into smaller LMs. MAGDi teaches smaller models by representing multi-agent interactions as graphs, augmenting a base student model with a graph encoder, and distilling knowledge using three objective functions: next-token prediction, a contrastive loss between correct and incorrect reasoning, and a graph-based objective to model the interaction structure. Experiments on seven widely used commonsense and math reasoning benchmarks show that MAGDi improves the reasoning capabilities of smaller models, outperforming several methods that distill from a single teacher and multiple teachers. Moreover, MAGDi also demonstrates an order of magnitude higher efficiency over its teachers. We conduct extensive analyses to show that MAGDi (1) enhances the generalizability to out-of-domain tasks, (2) scales positively with the size and strength of the base student model, and (3) obtains larger improvements (via our multi-teacher training) when applying self-consistency – an inference technique that relies on model diversity."}
{"title": "Prompting is a Double-Edged Sword: Improving Worst-Group Robustness of Foundation Models", "abstract": "Machine learning models fail catastrophically under distribution shift, but a surprisingly effective way to empirically improve robustness to some types of shift (*e.g.*, Imagenet-A/C) is to use stronger open-vocabulary classifiers derived from foundation models. In this work, we first note that for shifts governed by spurious correlations (features spuriously correlated with the label on the training data, but not on test), the zero-shot and few-shot performance of foundation models is no better than ERM models, and remains unchanged when pretrained data/model size is scaled. Secondly, even in these situations, foundation models are quite accurate at predicting the value of the spurious feature. In a simplified setup, we theoretically analyze both these findings. Specifically, we show that during contrastive pretraining, the simplicity bias of foundation models tends to result in the learning of features that mostly rely on the spurious attribute, compared to more robust features. We leverage these observations to propose Prompting for Robustness (PfR) which first uses foundation models to zero-shot predict the spurious attribute on labeled examples, and then learns a classifier with balanced performance across different groups of labels and spurious attribute. Across 5 vision and language tasks, we show that PfR's performance nearly equals that of an oracle algorithm (group DRO) that leverages human labeled spurious attributes."}
{"title": "Large Language Models Can Automatically Engineer Features for Few-Shot Tabular Learning", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), with their remarkable ability to tackle challenging and unseen reasoning problems, hold immense potential for tabular learning, that is vital for many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel in-context learning framework, FeatLLM, which employs LLMs as feature engineers to produce an input data set that is optimally suited for tabular predictions. The generated features are used to infer class likelihood with a simple downstream machine learning model, such as linear regression and yields high performance few-shot learning. The proposed FeatLLM framework only uses this simple predictive model with the discovered features at inference time. Compared to existing LLM-based approaches, FeatLLM eliminates the need to send queries to the LLM for each sample at inference time. Moreover, it merely requires API-level access to LLMs, and overcomes prompt size limitations. As demonstrated across numerous tabular datasets from a wide range of domains, FeatLLM generates high-quality rules, significantly (10% on average) outperforming alternatives such as TabLLM and STUNT."}
{"title": "Video-of-Thought: Step-by-Step Video Reasoning from Perception to Cognition", "abstract": "Existing research of video understanding still struggles to achieve in-depth comprehension and reasoning in complex videos, primarily due to the under-exploration of two key bottlenecks: fine-grained spatial-temporal perceptive understanding and cognitive-level video scene comprehension. This paper bridges the gap by presenting a novel solution. We first introduce a novel video Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), MotionEpic, which achieves fine-grained pixel-level spatial-temporal video grounding by integrating video spatial-temporal scene graph (STSG) representation. Building upon MotionEpic, we then develop a Video-of-Thought (VoT) reasoning framework. VoT inherits the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) core, breaking down a complex task into simpler and manageable sub-problems, and addressing them step-by-step from a low-level pixel perception to high-level cognitive interpretation. Extensive experiments across various complex video QA benchmarks demonstrate that our overall framework strikingly boosts existing state-of-the-art. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at successfully implementing the CoT technique for achieving human-level video reasoning, where we show great potential in extending it to a wider range of video understanding scenarios. Systems and codes will be open later."}
{"title": "Amend to Alignment: Decoupled Prompt Tuning for Mitigating Spurious Correlation in Vision-Language Models", "abstract": "Fine-tuning the learnable prompt for a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), such as CLIP, has demonstrated exceptional efficiency in adapting to a broad range of downstream tasks. Existing prompt tuning methods for VLMs do not distinguish spurious features introduced by biased training data from invariant features, and employ a uniform alignment process when adapting to unseen target domains. This can impair the cross-modal feature alignment when the testing data significantly deviate from the distribution of the training data, resulting in a poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization performance. In this paper, we reveal that the prompt tuning failure in such OOD scenarios can be attribute to the undesired alignment between the textual and the spurious feature. As a solution, we propose **CoOPood**, a fine-grained prompt tuning method that can discern the causal features and deliberately align the text modality with the invariant feature. Specifically, we design two independent contrastive phases using two lightweight projection layers during the alignment, each with different objectives: 1) pulling the text embedding closer to invariant image embedding and 2) pushing text embedding away from spurious image embedding. We have illustrated that **CoOPood** can serve as a general framework for VLMs and can be seamlessly integrated with existing prompt tuning methods. Extensive experiments on various OOD datasets demonstrate the performance superiority over state-of-the-art methods."}

Using HarmBench, we conduct a large-scale comparison of 18 red teaming methods and 33 target LLMs and defenses, yielding novel insights. We also introduce a highly efficient adversarial training method that greatly enhances LLM robustness across a wide range of attacks, demonstrating how HarmBench enables codevelopment of attacks and defenses.

{"title": "Dense Reward for Free in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback", "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been credited as the key advance that has allowed Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively follow instructions and produce useful assistance. Classically, this involves generating completions from the LLM in response to a query before using a separate reward model to assign a score to the full completion. As an auto-regressive process, the LLM has to take many “actions” (selecting individual tokens) and only receives a single, sparse reward at the end of an episode, a setup that is known to be difficult to optimise in traditional reinforcement learning. In this work we leverage the fact that the reward model contains more information than just its scalar output, in particular, it calculates an attention map over tokens as part of the transformer architecture. We use these attention weights to redistribute the reward along the whole completion, effectively densifying the signal and highlighting the most important tokens, all without incurring extra computational cost or requiring any additional modelling. We demonstrate that, theoretically, this approach is equivalent to potential-based reward shaping, ensuring that the optimal policy remains unchanged. Empirically, we show that it stabilises training, accelerates the rate of learning, and, in practical cases, may lead to better local optima."}

While partial solutions exist, our method is the first to faithfully and holistically attribute not only input but also latent representations of transformer models with the computational efficiency similar to a single backward pass. Through extensive evaluations against existing methods on LLaMa 2, Mixtral 8x7b, Flan-T5 and vision transformer architectures, we demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses alternative methods in terms of faithfulness and enables the understanding of latent representations, opening up the door for concept-based explanations.

{"title": "One Prompt is not Enough: Automated Construction of a Mixture-of-Expert Prompts", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong generalization capabilities to novel tasks when prompted with language instructions and in-context demos. Since this ability sensitively depends on the quality of prompts, various methods have been explored to automate the instruction design. While these methods demonstrated promising results, they also restricted the searched prompt to one instruction. Such simplification significantly limits their capacity, as a single demo-free instruction might not be able to cover the entire complex problem space of the targeted task. To alleviate this issue, we adopt the Mixture-of-Expert paradigm and divide the problem space into a set of sub-regions; Each sub-region is governed by a specialized expert, equipped with both an instruction and a set of demos. A two-phase process is developed to construct the specialized expert for each region: (1) demo assignment: Inspired by the theoretical connection between in-context learning and kernel regression, we group demos into experts based on their semantic similarity; (2) instruction assignment: A region-based joint search of an instruction per expert complements the demos assigned to it, yielding a synergistic effect. The resulting method, codenamed Mixture-of-Prompts (MoP), achieves an average win rate of 81% against prior arts across several major benchmarks."}

Thus, we introduce StrokeNUWA, a pioneering work exploring a better visual representation \"stroke\" tokens on vector graphics, which is inherently visual semantics rich, naturally compatible with LLMs, and highly compressed. Equipped with stroke tokens, StrokeNUWA can significantly surpass traditional LLM-based and optimization-based methods across various metrics in the vector graphic generation task.

We find the naive combination of existing offline IL and online IL methods tends to behave poorly in this context, because the initial discriminator (often used in online IL) operates randomly and discordantly against the policy initialization, leading to misguided policy optimization and *unlearning* of pretraining knowledge. To overcome this challenge, we propose a principled offline-to-online IL method, named OLLIE, that simultaneously learns a near-expert policy initialization along with an *aligned discriminator initialization*, which can be seamlessly integrated into online IL, achieving smooth and fast finetuning. Empirically, OLLIE consistently and significantly outperforms the baseline methods in **20** challenging tasks, from continuous control to vision-based domains, in terms of performance, demonstration efficiency, and convergence speed.

While state-of-the-art (SoTA) compression methods boast impressive advancements in preserving benign task performance, the potential risks of compression in terms of safety and trustworthiness have been largely neglected. This study conducts the first, thorough evaluation of **three (3) leading LLMs** using **five (5) SoTA compression techniques** across **eight (8) trustworthiness dimensions**. Our experiments highlight the intricate interplay between compression and trustworthiness, revealing some interesting patterns. We find that quantization is currently a more effective approach than pruning in achieving efficiency and trustworthiness simultaneously. For instance, a 4-bit quantized model retains the trustworthiness of its original counterpart, but model pruning significantly degrades trustworthiness, even at 50% sparsity. Moreover, employing quantization within a moderate bit range could unexpectedly improve certain trustworthiness dimensions such as ethics and fairness. Conversely, extreme quantization to very low bit levels (3 bits) tends to reduce trustworthiness significantly. This increased risk cannot be uncovered by looking at benign performance alone, in turn, mandating comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation in practice. These findings culminate in practical recommendations for simultaneously achieving high utility, efficiency, and trustworthiness in LLMs. Code and models are available at https://decoding-comp-trust.github.io."}
{"title": "Discovering Bias in Latent Space: An Unsupervised Debiasing Approach", "abstract": "The question-answering (QA) capabilities of foundation models are highly sensitive to prompt variations, rendering their performance susceptible to superficial, non-meaning-altering changes. This vulnerability often stems from the model's preference or bias towards specific input characteristics, such as option position or superficial image features in multi-modal settings. We propose to rectify this bias directly in the model's internal representation. Our approach, SteerFair, finds the bias direction in the model's representation space and steers activation values away from it during inference. Specifically, we exploit the observation that bias often adheres to simple association rules, such as the spurious association between the first option and correctness likelihood. Next, we construct demonstrations of these rules from unlabeled samples and use them to identify the bias directions. We empirically show that SteerFair significantly reduces instruction-tuned model performance variance across prompt modifications on three benchmark tasks. Remarkably, our approach surpasses a supervised baseline with 100 labels by an average of 10.86% accuracy points and 12.95 score points and matches the performance with 500 labels."}
{"title": "Causality Based Front-door Defense Against Backdoor Attack on Language Models", "abstract": "We have developed a new framework based on the theory of causal inference to protect language models against backdoor attacks. Backdoor attackers can poison language models with different types of triggers, such as words, sentences, grammar, and style, enabling them to selectively modify the decision-making of the victim model. However, existing defense approaches are only effective when the backdoor attack form meets specific assumptions, making it difficult to counter diverse backdoor attacks. We propose a new defense framework **F**ront-door **A**djustment for **B**ackdoor **E**limination (FABE) based on causal reasoning that does not rely on assumptions about the form of triggers. This method effectively differentiates between spurious and legitimate associations by creating a 'front door' that maps out the actual causal relationships. The term 'front door' refers to a text that retains the semantic equivalence of the initial input, which is generated by an additional, fine-tuned language model, denoted as the defense model. Our defense experiments against various attack methods at the token, sentence, and syntactic levels reduced the attack success rate from 93.63% to 15.12%, improving the defense effect by 2.91 times compared to the best baseline result of 66.61%, achieving state-of-the-art results. Through ablation study analysis, we analyzed the effect of each module in FABE, demonstrating the importance of complying with the front-door criterion and front-door adjustment formula, which also explains why previous methods failed.

LQER leverages an activation-induced scale matrix to drive the singular value distribution of quantization error towards a desirable distribution, which enables nearly-lossless W4A8 quantization on various LLMs and downstream tasks without the need for knowledge distillation, grid search, or gradient-based iterative optimization. Unlike existing methods, the computation pattern of LQER eliminates the need for specialized Scatter and Gather processes to collect high-precision weights from irregular memory locations. Our W4A8 LLMs achieve near-lossless performance on six popular downstream tasks, while using $1.36 \\times$ fewer hardware resources than the leading state-of-the-art method. We will open-source our framework at [https://github.com/ChengZhang-98/lqer](https://github.com/ChengZhang-98/lqer)"}
{"title": "MLLM-as-a-Judge: Assessing Multimodal LLM-as-a-Judge with Vision-Language Benchmark", "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention recently, showing remarkable potential in artificial general intelligence. However, assessing the utility of MLLMs presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the absence multimodal benchmarks that align with human preferences. Drawing inspiration from the concept of LLM-as-a-Judge within LLMs, this paper introduces a novel benchmark, termed MLLM-as-a-Judge, to assess the ability of MLLMs in assisting judges across diverse modalities, encompassing three distinct tasks: Scoring Evaluation, Pair Comparison, and Batch Ranking. Our study reveals that, while MLLMs demonstrate remarkable human-like discernment in Pair Comparisons, there is a significant divergence from human preferences in Scoring Evaluation and Batch Ranking tasks. Furthermore, a closer examination reveals persistent challenges in the evaluative capacities of LLMs, including diverse biases, hallucinatory responses, and inconsistencies in judgment, even in advanced models such as GPT-4V. These findings emphasize the pressing need for enhancements and further research efforts to be undertaken before regarding MLLMs as fully reliable evaluators. In light of this, we advocate for additional efforts dedicated to supporting the continuous development within the domain of MLLM functioning as judges. The code and dataset are publicly available at our project homepage: https://mllm-judge.github.io/."}
{"title": "Understanding Reasoning Ability of Language Models From the Perspective of Reasoning Paths Aggregation", "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (LMs) are able to perform complex reasoning without explicit fine-tuning. To understand how pre-training with a next-token prediction objective contributes to the emergence of such reasoning capability, we propose that we can view an LM as deriving new conclusions by aggregating indirect reasoning paths seen at pre-training time. We found this perspective effective in two important cases of reasoning: logic reasoning with knowledge graphs (KGs) and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. More specifically, we formalize the reasoning paths as random walk paths on the knowledge/reasoning graphs. Analyses of learned LM distributions suggest that a weighted sum of relevant random walk path probabilities is a reasonable way to explain how LMs reason. Experiments and analysis on multiple KG and CoT datasets reveal the effect of training on random walk paths and suggest that augmenting unlabeled random walk reasoning paths can improve real-world multi-step reasoning performance."}
{"title": "Stop Regressing: Training Value Functions via Classification for Scalable Deep RL", "abstract": "Value functions are an essential component in deep reinforcement learning (RL), that are typically trained via mean squared error regression to match bootstrapped target values. However, scaling value-based RL methods to large networks has proven challenging. This difficulty is in stark contrast to supervised learning: by leveraging a cross-entropy classification loss, supervised methods have scaled reliably to massive networks. Observing this discrepancy, in this paper, we investigate whether the scalability of deep RL can also be improved simply by using classification in place of regression for training value functions. We show that training value functions with categorical cross-entropy significantly enhances performance and scalability across various domains, including single-task RL on Atari 2600 games, multi-task RL on Atari with large-scale ResNets, robotic manipulation with Q-transformers, playing Chess without search, and a language-agent Wordle task with high-capacity Transformers, achieving *state-of-the-art results* on these domains. Through careful analysis, we show that categorical cross-entropy mitigates issues inherent to value-based RL, such as noisy targets and non-stationarity. We argue that shifting to categorical cross-entropy for training value functions can substantially improve the scalability of deep RL at little-to-no cost."}
{"title": "Compositional Text-to-Image Generation with Dense Blob Representations", "abstract": "Existing text-to-image models struggle to follow complex text prompts, raising the need for extra grounding inputs for better controllability. In this work, we propose to decompose a scene into visual primitives - denoted as dense blob representations - that contain fine-grained details of the scene while being modular, human-interpretable, and easy-to-construct. Based on blob representations, we develop a blob-grounded text-to-image diffusion model, termed BlobGEN, for compositional generation. Particularly, we introduce a new masked cross-attention module to disentangle the fusion between blob representations and visual features. To leverage the compositionality of large language models (LLMs), we introduce a new in-context learning approach to generate blob representations from text prompts. Our extensive experiments show that BlobGEN achieves superior zero-shot generation quality and better layout-guided controllability on MS-COCO. When augmented by LLMs, our method exhibits superior numerical and spatial correctness on compositional image generation benchmarks."}
{"title": "Position: A Safe Harbor for AI Evaluation and Red Teaming", "abstract": "Independent evaluation and red teaming are critical for identifying the risks posed by generative AI systems. However, the terms of service and enforcement strategies used by prominent AI companies to deter model misuse have disincentives on good faith safety evaluations. This causes some researchers to fear that conducting such research or releasing their findings will result in account suspensions or legal reprisal. Although some companies offer researcher access programs, they are an inadequate substitute for independent research access, as they have limited community representation, receive inadequate funding, and lack independence from corporate incentives. We propose that major generative AI developers commit to providing a legal and technical safe harbor, protecting public interest safety research and removing the threat of account suspensions or legal reprisal. These proposals emerged from our collective experience conducting safety, privacy, and trustworthiness research on generative AI systems, where norms and incentives could be better aligned with public interests, without exacerbating model misuse. We believe these commitments are a necessary step towards more inclusive and unimpeded community efforts to tackle the risks of generative AI."}
{"title": "In-context Vectors: Making In Context Learning More Effective and Controllable Through Latent Space Steering", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate emergent in-context learning capabilities, where they adapt to new tasks based on example demonstrations. However, in-context learning has seen limited effectiveness in many settings, is difficult to quantitatively control and takes up context window space. To overcome these limitations, we propose an alternative approach that recasts in-context learning as in-context vectors (ICV). Using ICV has two steps. We first use a forward pass on demonstration examples to create the in-context vector from the latent embedding of the LLM. This vector captures essential information about the intended task. On a new query, instead of adding demonstrations to the prompt, we shift the latent states of the LLM using the ICV. The ICV approach has several benefits: 1) it enables the LLM to more effectively follow the demonstration examples; 2) it's easy to control by adjusting the magnitude of the ICV; 3) it reduces the length of the prompt by removing the in-context demonstrations; 4) ICV is computationally much more efficient than fine-tuning. We demonstrate that ICV achieves better performance compared to standard in-context learning and fine-tuning on diverse tasks including safety, style transfer, role-playing and formatting. Moreover, we show that we can flexibly teach LLM to simultaneously follow different types of instructions by simple vector arithmetics on the corresponding ICVs."}
{"title": "A Mechanistic Understanding of Alignment Algorithms: A Case Study on DPO and Toxicity", "abstract": "While alignment algorithms are commonly used to tune pre-trained language models towards user preferences, we lack explanations for the underlying mechanisms in which models become ``aligned'', thus making it difficult to explain phenomena like jailbreaks. In this work we study a popular algorithm, direct preference optimization (DPO), and the mechanisms by which it reduces toxicity. Namely, we first study how toxicity is represented and elicited in pre-trained language models (GPT2-medium, Llama2-7b). We then apply DPO with a carefully crafted pairwise dataset to reduce toxicity. We examine how the resulting models avert toxic outputs, and find that capabilities learned from pre-training are not removed, but rather bypassed. We use this insight to demonstrate a simple method to un-align the models, reverting them back to their toxic behavior."}
{"title": "InfiAgent-DABench: Evaluating Agents on Data Analysis Tasks", "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce InfiAgent-DABench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM-based agents on data analysis tasks. Agents need to solve these tasks end-to-end by interacting with an execution environment. This benchmark contains DAEval, a dataset consisting of 603 data analysis questions derived from 124 CSV files, and an agent framework which incorporates LLMs to serve as data analysis agents for both serving and evaluating. Since data analysis questions are often open-ended and hard to evaluate without human supervision, we adopt a format-prompting technique to convert each question into a closed-form format so that they can be automatically evaluated. Our extensive benchmarking of 34 LLMs uncovers the current challenges encountered in data analysis tasks. In addition, building upon our agent framework, we develop a specialized agent, DAAgent, which surpasses GPT-3.5 by 3.9% on DABench. Evaluation datasets and toolkits for InfiAgent-DABench are released at https://github.com/InfiAgent/InfiAgent."}
{"title": "From Yes-Men to Truth-Tellers: Addressing Sycophancy in Large Language Models with Pinpoint Tuning", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to prioritize adherence to user prompts over providing veracious responses, leading to the sycophancy issue. When challenged by users, LLMs tend to admit mistakes and provide inaccurate responses even if they initially provided the correct answer. Recent works propose to employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to mitigate the sycophancy issue, while it typically leads to the degeneration of LLMs' general capability. To address the challenge, we propose a novel supervised pinpoint tuning (SPT), where the region-of-interest modules are tuned for a given objective. Specifically, SPT first reveals and verifies a small percentage (<5%) of the basic modules, which significantly affect a particular behavior of LLMs. i.e., sycophancy. Subsequently, SPT merely fine-tunes these identified modules while freezing the rest. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed SPT, we conduct comprehensive experiments, demonstrating that SPT significantly mitigates the sycophancy issue of LLMs (even better than SFT). Moreover, SPT introduces limited or even no side effects on the general capability of LLMs. Our results shed light on how to precisely, effectively, and efficiently explain and improve the targeted ability of LLMs."}
{"title": "GRATH: Gradual Self-Truthifying for Large Language Models", "abstract": "Truthfulness is paramount for large language models (LLMs) as they are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. However, existing LLMs still struggle with generating truthful content, as evidenced by their modest performance on benchmarks like TruthfulQA. To address this issue, we propose GRAdual self-truTHifying (GRATH), a novel post-processing method to enhance truthfulness of LLMs. GRATH utilizes out-of-domain question prompts to generate pairwise truthfulness training data with each pair containing a question and its correct and incorrect answers, and then optimizes the model via direct preference optimization (DPO) to learn from the truthfulness difference between answer pairs. GRATH iteratively refines truthfulness data and updates the model, leading to a gradual improvement in model truthfulness in a self-supervised manner. Empirically, we evaluate GRATH using different 7B-LLMs and compare with LLMs with similar or even larger sizes on benchmark datasets. Our results show that GRATH effectively improves LLMs' truthfulness without compromising other core capabilities. Notably, GRATH achieves state-of-the-art performance on TruthfulQA, with MC1 accuracy of 54.71% and MC2 accuracy of 69.10%, which even surpass those on 70B-LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/chenweixin107/GRATH."}
{"title": "Federated Full-Parameter Tuning of Billion-Sized Language Models with Communication Cost under 18 Kilobytes", "abstract": "Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) need fine-tuning to improve their responsiveness to natural language instructions. Federated learning offers a way to fine-tune LLMs using the abundant data on end devices without compromising data privacy. Most existing federated fine-tuning methods for LLMs rely on parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, which may not reach the performance height possible with full-parameter tuning. However, federated full-parameter tuning of LLMs is a non-trivial problem due to the immense communication cost. This work introduces FedKSeed that employs zeroth-order optimization with a finite set of random seeds. It significantly reduces transmission requirements between the server and clients to just a few random seeds and scalar gradients, amounting to only a few thousand bytes, making federated full-parameter tuning of billion-sized LLMs possible on devices. Building on it, we develop a strategy enabling probability-differentiated seed sampling, prioritizing perturbations with greater impact on model accuracy. Experiments across six scenarios with various LLMs, datasets and data partitions demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing federated LLM fine-tuning methods in both communication efficiency and zero-shot generalization."}
{"title": "Long-Tail Learning with Foundation Model: Heavy Fine-Tuning Hurts", "abstract": "The fine-tuning paradigm in addressing long-tail learning tasks has sparked significant interest since the emergence of foundation models. Nonetheless, how fine-tuning impacts performance in long-tail learning was not explicitly quantified. In this paper, we disclose that heavy fine-tuning may even lead to non-negligible performance deterioration on tail classes, and lightweight fine-tuning is more effective. The reason is attributed to inconsistent class conditions caused by heavy fine-tuning. With the observation above, we develop a low-complexity and accurate long-tail learning algorithms LIFT with the goal of facilitating fast prediction and compact models by adaptive lightweight fine-tuning. Experiments clearly verify that both the training time and the learned parameters are significantly reduced with more accurate predictive performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

{"title": "Variational Learning is Effective for Large Deep Networks", "abstract": "We give extensive empirical evidence against the common belief that variational learning is ineffective for large neural networks. We show that an optimizer called Improved Variational Online Newton (IVON) consistently matches or outperforms Adam for training large networks such as GPT-2 and ResNets from scratch. IVON's computational costs are nearly identical to Adam but its predictive uncertainty is better. We show several new use cases of IVON where we improve finetuning and model merging in Large Language Models, accurately predict generalization error, and faithfully estimate sensitivity to data. We find overwhelming evidence that variational learning is effective. Code is available at https://github.com/team-approx-bayes/ivon."}
{"title": "Understanding Finetuning for Factual Knowledge Extraction", "abstract": "In this work, we study the impact of QA fine-tuning data on downstream factuality. We show that fine-tuning on lesser-known facts that are poorly stored during pretraining yields significantly worse factuality than fine-tuning on well-known facts, even when all facts are seen during pretraining. We prove this phenomenon theoretically, showing that training on lesser-known facts can lead the model to ignore subject entity names and instead output a generic plausible response even when the relevant factual knowledge is encoded in the model. On three question answering benchmarks (PopQA, Entity Questions, and MMLU) and two language models (Llama-2-7B and Mistral-7B), we find that (i) finetuning on a completely factual but lesser-known subset of the data deteriorates downstream factuality (5-10%) and (ii) finetuning on a subset of better-known examples matches or outperforms finetuning on the entire dataset. Ultimately, our results shed light on the interaction between pretrained knowledge and finetuning data and demonstrate the importance of taking into account how facts are stored in the pretrained model when fine-tuning for knowledge-intensive tasks."}
{"title": "Towards Causal Foundation Model: on Duality between Optimal Balancing and Attention", "abstract": "Foundation models have brought changes to the landscape of machine learning, demonstrating sparks of human-level intelligence across a diverse array of tasks. However, a gap persists in complex tasks such as causal inference, primarily due to challenges associated with intricate reasoning steps and high numerical precision requirements. In this work, we take a first step towards building causally-aware foundation models for treatment effect estimations. We propose a novel, theoretically justified method called Causal Inference with Attention (CInA), which utilizes multiple unlabeled datasets to perform self-supervised causal learning, and subsequently enables zero-shot causal inference on unseen tasks with new data. This is based on our theoretical results that demonstrate the primal-dual connection between optimal covariate balancing and self-attention, facilitating zero-shot causal inference through the final layer of a trained transformer-type architecture. We demonstrate empirically that CInA effectively generalizes to out-of-distribution datasets and various real-world datasets, matching or even surpassing traditional per-dataset methodologies. These results provide compelling evidence that our method has the potential to serve as a stepping stone for the development of causal foundation models."}
{"title": "AST-T5: Structure-Aware Pretraining for Code Generation and Understanding", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in code-related tasks, yet many LLMs treat code as simple sequences, neglecting its structured nature. We introduce AST-T5, a novel pretraining paradigm that leverages the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for enhanced code generation, transpilation, and understanding. Using dynamic programming, our AST-Aware Segmentation retains code structure, while our AST-Aware Span Corruption objective equips the model to reconstruct various code structures. Unlike other models, AST-T5 avoids complex program analyses or architectural changes, so it integrates seamlessly with any encoder-decoder Transformer. Evaluations show that AST-T5 consistently outperforms similar-sized LMs across various code-related tasks including HumanEval and MBPP. Structure-awareness makes AST-T5 particularly powerful in code-to-code tasks, surpassing CodeT5 by 2 points in exact match score for the Bugs2Fix task and by 3 points in exact match score for Java-C# Transpilation in CodeXGLUE. Our code and model are publicly available at https://github.com/gonglinyuan/ast_t5."}
{"title": "Transforming and Combining Rewards for Aligning Large Language Models", "abstract": "A common approach for aligning language models to human preferences is to first learn a reward model from preference data, and then use this reward model to update the language model. We study two closely related problems that arise in this approach. First, any monotone transformation of the reward model preserves preference ranking; is there a choice that is \"better\" than others? Second, we often wish to align language models to multiple properties: how should we combine multiple reward models? Using a probabilistic interpretation of the alignment procedure, we identify a natural choice for transformation for (the common case of) rewards learned from Bradley-Terry preference models. The derived transformation is straightforward: we apply a log-sigmoid function to the centered rewards, a method we term \"LSC-transformation\" (log-sigmoid-centered transformation). This transformation has two important properties. First, it emphasizes improving poorly-performing outputs, rather than outputs that already score well. This mitigates both underfitting (where some prompts are not improved) and reward hacking (where the model learns to exploit misspecification of the reward model). Second, it enables principled aggregation of rewards by linking summation to logical conjunction: the sum of transformed rewards corresponds to the probability that the output is \"good\" in all measured properties, in a sense we make precise. Experiments aligning language models to be both helpful and harmless using RLHF show substantial improvements over the baseline (non-transformed) approach."}
{"title": "A Resilient and Accessible Distribution-Preserving Watermark for Large Language Models", "abstract": "Watermarking techniques offer a promising way to identify machine-generated content via embedding covert information into the contents generated from language models. A challenge in the domain lies in preserving the distribution of original generated content after watermarking. Our research extends and improves upon existing watermarking framework, placing emphasis on the importance of a Distribution-Preserving (DiP) watermark. Contrary to the current strategies, our proposed DiPmark simultaneously preserves the original token distribution during watermarking (distribution-preserving), is detectable without access to the language model API and prompts (accessible), and is provably robust to moderate changes of tokens (resilient). DiPmark operates by selecting a random set of tokens prior to the generation of a word, then modifying the token distribution through a distribution-preserving reweight function to enhance the probability of these selected tokens during the sampling process. Extensive empirical evaluation on various language models and tasks demonstrates our approach's distribution-preserving property, accessibility, and resilience, making it a effective solution for watermarking tasks that demand impeccable quality preservation."}
{"title": "Iterative Preference Learning from Human Feedback: Bridging Theory and Practice for RLHF under KL-constraint", "abstract": "This paper studies the theoretical framework of the alignment process of generative models with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We consider a standard mathematical formulation, the reverse-KL regularized contextual bandit for RLHF. Despite its widespread practical application, a rigorous theoretical analysis of this formulation remains open. We investigate its behavior in three distinct settings---offline, online, and hybrid---and propose efficient algorithms with finite-sample theoretical guarantees. Moving towards practical applications, our framework, with a robust approximation of the information-theoretical policy improvement oracle, naturally gives rise to several novel RLHF algorithms. This includes an iterative version of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm for online settings, and a multi-step rejection sampling strategy for offline scenarios. Our empirical evaluations on real-world alignment experiment of large language model demonstrate that these proposed methods significantly surpass existing strong baselines, such as DPO and Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO), showcasing the connections between solid theoretical foundations and their potent practical implementations."}
{"title": "A Language Model’s Guide Through Latent Space", "abstract": "Concept guidance has emerged as a cheap and simple way to control the behavior of language models by probing their hidden representations for concept vectors and using them to perturb activations at inference time. While the focus of previous work has largely been on *truthfulness*, in this paper we extend this framework to a richer set of concepts such as *appropriateness*, *humor*, *creativity* and *quality*, and explore to what degree current detection and guidance strategies work in these challenging settings. To facilitate evaluation, we develop a novel metric for concept guidance that takes into account both the success of concept elicitation as well as the potential degradation in fluency of the guided model. Our extensive experiments reveal that while some concepts such as *truthfulness* more easily allow for guidance with current techniques, novel concepts such as *appropriateness* or *humor* either remain difficult to elicit, need extensive tuning to work, or even experience confusion. Moreover, we find that probes with optimal detection accuracies do not necessarily make for the optimal guides, contradicting previous observations for *truthfulness*. Our work warrants a deeper investigation into the interplay between detectability, guidability, and the nature of the concept, and we hope that our rich experimental test-bed for guidance research inspires stronger follow-up approaches."}
{"title": "What Will My Model Forget? Forecasting Forgotten Examples in Language Model Refinement", "abstract": "Language models deployed in the wild make errors. However, simply updating the model with the corrected error instances causes catastrophic forgetting---the updated model makes errors on instances learned during the instruction tuning or upstream training phase. Randomly replaying upstream data yields unsatisfactory performance and often comes with high variance and poor controllability. To this end, we try to forecast upstream examples that will be forgotten due to a model update for improved controllability of the replay process and interpretability. We train forecasting models given a collection of online learned examples and corresponding forgotten upstream pre-training examples. We propose a partially interpretable forecasting model based on the observation that changes in pre-softmax logit scores of pretraining examples resemble that of online learned examples, which performs decently on BART but fails on T5 models. We further show a black-box classifier based on inner products of example representations achieves better forecasting performance over a series of setups. Finally, we show that we reduce forgetting of upstream pretraining examples by replaying examples that are forecasted to be forgotten, demonstrating the practical utility of forecasting example forgetting."}
{"title": "Decomposing Uncertainty for Large Language Models through Input Clarification Ensembling", "abstract": "Uncertainty decomposition refers to the task of decomposing the total uncertainty of a predictive model into aleatoric (data) uncertainty, resulting from inherent randomness in the data-generating process, and epistemic (model) uncertainty, resulting from missing information in the model's training data. In large language models (LLMs) specifically, identifying sources of uncertainty is an important step toward improving reliability, trustworthiness, and interpretability, but remains an important open research question. In this paper, we introduce an uncertainty decomposition framework for LLMs, called input clarification ensembling, which can be applied to any pre-trained LLM. Our approach generates a set of clarifications for the input, feeds them into an LLM, and ensembles the corresponding predictions. We show that, when aleatoric uncertainty arises from ambiguity or under-specification in LLM inputs, this approach makes it possible to factor an (un-clarified) LLM's predictions into separate aleatoric and epistemic terms, using a decomposition similar to the one employed by Bayesian neural networks. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that input clarification ensembling provides accurate and reliable uncertainty quantification on several language processing tasks.

{"title": "Autoformalizing Euclidean Geometry", "abstract": "Autoformalization involves automatically translating informal math into formal theorems and proofs that are machine-verifiable. Euclidean geometry provides an interesting and controllable domain for studying autoformalization. In this paper, we introduce a neuro-symbolic framework for autoformalizing Euclidean geometry, which combines domain knowledge, SMT solvers, and large language models (LLMs). One challenge in Euclidean geometry is that informal proofs rely on diagrams, leaving gaps in texts that are hard to formalize. To address this issue, we use theorem provers to fill in such diagrammatic information automatically, so that the LLM only needs to autoformalize the explicit textual steps, making it easier for the model. We also provide automatic semantic evaluation for autoformalized theorem statements. We construct LeanEuclid, an autoformalization benchmark consisting of problems from Euclid's Elements and the UniGeo dataset formalized in the Lean proof assistant. Experiments with GPT-4 and GPT-4V show the capability and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs on autoformalizing geometry problems.

{"title": "Split-and-Denoise: Protect large language model inference with local differential privacy", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language understanding by capturing hidden semantics in vector space. This process enriches the value of text embeddings for various downstream tasks, thereby fostering the Embedding-as-a-Service (EaaS) business model. However, the risk of privacy leakage due to direct text transmission to servers remains a critical concern. To address this, we introduce Split-N-Denoise (SnD), an private inference framework that splits the model to execute the token embedding layer on the client side at minimal computational cost. This allows the client to introduce noise prior to transmitting the embeddings to the server, and subsequently receive and denoise the perturbed output embeddings for downstream tasks. Our approach is designed for the inference stage of LLMs and requires no modifications to the model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate SnD’s effectiveness in optimizing the privacy-utility tradeoff across various LLM architectures and diverse downstream tasks. The results reveal an improvement in performance under the same privacy budget compared to the baselines by over 10% on average, offering clients a privacy-preserving solution for local privacy protection."}
{"title": "Monitoring AI-Modified Content at Scale: A Case Study on the Impact of ChatGPT on AI Conference Peer Reviews", "abstract": "We present an approach for estimating the fraction of text in a large corpus which is likely to be substantially modified or produced by a large language model (LLM). Our maximum likelihood model leverages expert-written and AI-generated reference texts to accurately and efficiently examine real-world LLM-use at the corpus level. We apply this approach to a case study of scientific peer review in AI conferences that took place after the release of ChatGPT: *ICLR* 2024, *NeurIPS* 2023, *CoRL* 2023 and *EMNLP* 2023. Our results suggest that between 6.5% and 16.9% of text submitted as peer reviews to these conferences could have been substantially modified by LLMs, i.e. beyond spell-checking or minor writing updates. The circumstances in which generated text occurs offer insight into user behavior: the estimated fraction of LLM-generated text is higher in reviews which report lower confidence, were submitted close to the deadline, and from reviewers who are less likely to respond to author rebuttals. We also observe corpus-level trends in generated text which may be too subtle to detect at the individual level, and discuss the implications of such trends on peer review. We call for future interdisciplinary work to examine how LLM use is changing our information and knowledge practices."}
{"title": "Safety Fine-Tuning at (Almost) No Cost: A Baseline for Vision Large Language Models", "abstract": "Current vision large language models (VLLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities yet are prone to generate harmful content and are vulnerable to even the simplest jailbreaking attacks. Our initial analysis finds that this is due to the presence of harmful data during vision-language instruction fine-tuning, and that VLLM fine-tuning can cause forgetting of safety alignment previously learned by the underpinning LLM. To address this issue, we first curate a vision-language safe instruction-following dataset VLGuard covering various harmful categories. Our experiments demonstrate that integrating this dataset into standard vision-language fine-tuning or utilizing it for post-hoc fine-tuning effectively safety aligns VLLMs. This alignment is achieved with minimal impact on, or even enhancement of, the models' helpfulness. The versatility of our safety fine-tuning dataset makes it a valuable resource for safety-testing existing VLLMs, training new models or safeguarding pre-trained VLLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that fine-tuned VLLMs effectively reject unsafe instructions and substantially reduce the success rates of several black-box adversarial attacks, which approach zero in many cases.

{"title": "Position: TrustLLM: Trustworthiness in Large Language Models", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have gained considerable attention for their excellent natural language processing capabilities. Nonetheless, these LLMs present many challenges, particularly in the realm of trustworthiness. This paper introduces TrustLLM, a comprehensive study of trustworthiness in LLMs, including principles for different dimensions of trustworthiness, established benchmark, evaluation, and analysis of trustworthiness for mainstream LLMs, and discussion of open challenges and future directions. Specifically, we first propose a set of principles for trustworthy LLMs that span eight different dimensions. Based on these principles, we further establish a benchmark across six dimensions including truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and machine ethics. We then present a study evaluating 16 mainstream LLMs in TrustLLM, consisting of over 30 datasets. Our findings firstly show that in general trustworthiness and capability (i.e., functional effectiveness) are positively related. Secondly, our observations reveal that proprietary LLMs generally outperform most open-source counterparts in terms of trustworthiness, raising concerns about the potential risks of widely accessible open-source LLMs. However, a few open-source LLMs come very close to proprietary ones, suggesting that open-source models can achieve high levels of trustworthiness without additional mechanisms like *moderator*, offering valuable insights for developers in this field. Thirdly, it is important to note that some LLMs may be overly calibrated towards exhibiting trustworthiness, to the extent that they compromise their utility by mistakenly treating benign prompts as harmful and consequently not responding. Besides these observations, we've uncovered key insights into the multifaceted trustworthiness in LLMs. We emphasize the importance of ensuring transparency not only in the models themselves but also in the technologies that underpin trustworthiness. We advocate that the establishment of an AI alliance between industry, academia, the open-source community to foster collaboration is imperative to advance the trustworthiness of LLMs."}
{"title": "Preference Fine-Tuning of LLMs Should Leverage Suboptimal, On-Policy Data", "abstract": "Learning from preference labels plays a crucial role in fine-tuning large language models --- this is done via supervised learning, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL), or contrastive learning. Different methods come with different implementation tradeoffs, and existing empirical findings present different conclusions, for instance, some results show that online RL is quite important to attain good fine-tuning results, while others find offline methods sufficient. This raises a question: **what kind of approaches are important for fine-tuning with preference data and why?** In this paper, we answer this question by performing a rigorous analysis of a number of fine-tuning techniques on didactic and full-scale LLM problems. Our main finding is that approaches that use on-policy sampling and attempt to push down the likelihood on certain responses (i.e., employ a ''negative gradient'') outperform offline and maximum likelihood objectives. We conceptualize our insights and unify methods that use on-policy sampling or negative gradient under a notion of mode-seeking objectives for categorical distributions. Mode-seeking objectives are able to alter probability mass on specific bins of a categorical distribution at a fast rate compared to maximum likelihood, allowing them to relocate masses across bins more effectively. Our analysis prescribes actionable insights for preference fine-tuning of LLMs and informs how data should be collected for maximal improvement."}
{"title": "Controlled Decoding from Language Models", "abstract": "KL-regularized reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular alignment framework to control the language model responses towards high reward outcomes. We pose a tokenwise RL objective and propose a modular solver for it, called *controlled decoding (CD)*. CD exerts control through a separate *prefix scorer* module, which is trained to learn a value function for the reward. The prefix scorer is used at inference time to control the generation from a frozen base model, provably sampling from a solution to the RL objective. We empirically demonstrate that CD is effective as a control mechanism on popular benchmarks. We also show that prefix scorers for multiple rewards may be combined at inference time, effectively solving a multi-objective RL problem with no additional training. We show that the benefits of applying CD transfer to an unseen base model with no further tuning as well. Finally, we show that CD can be applied in a blockwise decoding fashion at inference-time, essentially bridging the gap between the popular best-of-$K$ strategy and tokenwise control through reinforcement learning. This makes CD a promising approach for alignment of language models."}
{"title": "Watermarks in the Sand: Impossibility of Strong Watermarking for Language Models", "abstract": "Watermarking generative models consists of planting a statistical signal (watermark) in a model's output so that it can be later verified that the output was generated by the given model. A strong watermarking scheme satisfies the property that a computationally bounded attacker cannot erase the watermark without causing significant quality degradation. In this paper, we study the (im)possibility of strong watermarking schemes. We prove that, under well-specified and natural assumptions, strong watermarking is impossible to achieve. This holds even in the private detection algorithm setting, where the watermark insertion and detection algorithms share a secret key, unknown to the attacker. To prove this result, we introduce a generic efficient watermark attack; the attacker is not required to know the private key of the scheme or even which scheme is used. Our attack is based on two assumptions: (1) The attacker has access to a \"quality oracle\" that can evaluate whether a candidate output is a high-quality response to a prompt, and (2) The attacker has access to a \"perturbation oracle\" which can modify an output with a nontrivial probability of maintaining quality, and which induces an efficiently mixing random walk on high-quality outputs. We argue that both assumptions can be satisfied in practice by an attacker with weaker computational capabilities than the watermarked model itself, to which the attacker has only black-box access. Furthermore, our assumptions will likely only be easier to satisfy over time as models grow in capabilities and modalities. We demonstrate the feasibility of our attack by instantiating it to attack three existing watermarking schemes for large language models: Kirchenbauer et al. (2023), Kuditipudi et al. (2023), and Zhao et al. (2023), and include preliminary results on vision-language models. The same attack successfully removes the watermarks planted by all schemes, with only minor quality degradation."}
{"title": "ArCHer: Training Language Model Agents via Hierarchical Multi-Turn RL", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to tackle sequential decision-making problems due to their generalist capabilities. Instead of optimizing ``myopic'' surrogate objectives such as human preferences within a single turn, in such problems, we wish to directly optimize long-term objectives, such as user satisfaction over an entire dialogue with an LLM or delayed success metrics in web navigation. Multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) provides an appealing approach to directly optimize long-term objectives, but how can we design effective and efficient multi-turn RL algorithms for LLMs? In this work, we propose an algorithmic framework to multi-turn RL for LLMs that preserves the flexibility of token-by-token RL used in single-turn RL problems, while still accommodating long horizons and delayed rewards more effectively. Our framework, the **A**cto**r**-**C**ritic Framework with a **H**i**e**rarchical Structu**r**e (**ArCHer**), combines a high-level off-policy RL algorithm that trains a value function with a low-level RL algorithm that trains a token-by-token policy. While ArCHer can be instantiated with multiple RL algorithms, a particularly convenient instantiation is to use temporal difference (TD) learning at the high level and on-policy token-level policy gradient at the low level. Empirically, we show that ArCHer significantly improves efficiency and performance of multi-turn LLM tasks, attaining sample efficiency boosts of about **100x** over prior on-policy methods and converging to a much better performance than other off-policy methods."}
{"title": "Is In-Context Learning in Large Language Models Bayesian? A Martingale Perspective", "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a particularly remarkable characteristic of Large Language Models (LLM): given a pretrained LLM and an observed dataset, LLMs can make predictions for new data points from the same distribution without fine-tuning. Numerous works have postulated ICL as approximately Bayesian inference, rendering this a natural hypothesis. In this work, we analyse this hypothesis from a new angle through the *martingale property*, a fundamental requirement of a Bayesian learning system for exchangeable data. We show that the martingale property is a necessary condition for unambiguous predictions in such scenarios, and enables a principled, decomposed notion of uncertainty vital in trustworthy, safety-critical systems. We derive actionable checks with corresponding theory and test statistics which must hold if the martingale property is satisfied. We also examine if uncertainty in LLMs decreases as expected in Bayesian learning when more data is observed. In three experiments, we provide evidence for violations of the martingale property, and deviations from a Bayesian scaling behaviour of uncertainty, falsifying the hypothesis that ICL is Bayesian."}
{"title": "Spotting LLMs With Binoculars: Zero-Shot Detection of Machine-Generated Text", "abstract": "Detecting text generated by modern large language models is thought to be hard, as both LLMs and humans can exhibit a wide range of complex behaviors. However, we find that a score based on contrasting two closely related language models is highly accurate at separating human-generated and machine-generated text. Based on this mechanism, we propose a novel LLM detector that only requires simple calculations using a pair of pre-trained LLMs. The method, called *Binoculars*, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without any training data. It is capable of spotting machine text from a range of modern LLMs without any model-specific modifications. We comprehensively evaluate *Binoculars* on a number of text sources and in varied situations. Over a wide range of document types, *Binoculars* detects over 90% of generated samples from ChatGPT (and other LLMs) at a false positive rate of 0.01%, despite not being trained on any ChatGPT data.

The algorithm first utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to propose an initial segmentation of the trajectories. Following that, a hierarchical variational inference framework incorporates the LLM-generated segmentation information to discover reusable skills by merging trajectory segments. To further control the trade-off between compression and reusability, we introduce a novel auxiliary objective based on the Minimum Description Length principle that helps guide this skill discovery process. Our results demonstrate that agents equipped with our method are able to discover skills that help accelerate learning and outperform baseline skill learning approaches on new long-horizon tasks in BabyAI, a grid world navigation environment, as well as ALFRED, a household simulation environment."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to possess certain ToM abilities, the mechanisms underlying these capabilities remain elusive. In this study, we discover that it is possible to linearly decode the belief status from the perspectives of various agents through neural activations of language models, indicating the existence of internal representations of self and others' beliefs. By manipulating these representations, we observe dramatic changes in the models' ToM performance, underscoring their pivotal role in the social reasoning process. Additionally, our findings extend to diverse social reasoning tasks that involve different causal inference patterns, suggesting the potential generalizability of these representations."}
{"title": "Toward Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models with Thought Rollback", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been routinely used to solve various tasks using step-by-step reasoning. However, the structure of intermediate reasoning steps, or *thoughts*, is rigid and unidirectional, such as chains, trees, or acyclic-directed graphs. Consequently, the resulting inflexible and forward-only reasoning may not address challenging tasks and fail when the LLM frequently gives false responses, i.e., hallucinations. This paper proposes a new reasoning framework, called *Thought Rollback* (TR), allowing LLMs to adaptively build thought structure while maintaining effective reasoning toward problem-solving under hallucinations. The core mechanism of TR is *rolling back thoughts*, which allows LLMs to perform error analysis on thoughts, and thus roll back to any previously mistaken thought for revision. Subsequently, by including such trial-and-error in the prompt to guide the LLM, each rollback leads to one more reliable reasoning path. Therefore, starting with a simple prompt without human annotations, LLM with TR adaptively and gradually explores thoughts for a correct solution. Comprehensive experiments on mathematical problems and multi-task reasoning demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TR in terms of problem-solving rate and interaction cost. For instance, the solving rate of GPT-4 with TR outperforms the current best by $9\\%$ on the MATH dataset.

{"title": "Outlier Weighed Layerwise Sparsity (OWL): A Missing Secret Sauce for Pruning LLMs to High Sparsity", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), renowned for their remarkable performance across diverse domains, present a challenge due to their colossal model size when it comes to practical deployment. In response to this challenge, efforts have been directed toward the application of traditional network pruning techniques to LLMs, uncovering a massive number of parameters can be pruned in one-shot without hurting performance. Building upon insights gained from pre-LLM models, particularly BERT-level language models, prevailing LLM pruning strategies have consistently adhered to the practice of uniformly pruning all layers at equivalent sparsity levels, resulting in robust performance. However, this observation stands in contrast to the prevailing trends observed in the field of vision models, where non-uniform layerwise sparsity typically yields substantially improved results. To elucidate the underlying reasons for this disparity, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the distribution of token features within LLMs. In doing so, we discover a strong correlation with the emergence of outliers, defined as features exhibiting significantly greater magnitudes compared to their counterparts in feature dimensions. Inspired by this finding, we introduce a novel LLM pruning methodology that incorporates a tailored set of **non-uniform layerwise sparsity ratios** specifically designed for LLM pruning, termed as **O**utlier **W**eighed **L**ayerwise sparsity (**OWL**). The sparsity ratio of OWL is directly proportional to the outlier ratio observed within each layer, facilitating a more effective alignment between layerwise weight sparsity and outlier ratios. Our empirical evaluation, conducted across the LLaMA-V1/V2, Vicuna, OPT, and Mistral, spanning various benchmarks, demonstrates the distinct advantages offered by OWL over previous methods. For instance, OWL exhibits a remarkable performance gain, surpassing the state-of-the-art Wanda and SparseGPT by **61.22** and **6.80** perplexity at a high sparsity level of 70%, respectively, while delivering **2.6$\\times$** end-to-end inference speed-up in the DeepSparse inference engine.

{"title": "Improving Open-Ended Text Generation via Adaptive Decoding", "abstract": "Current language models decode text token by token according to probabilistic distribution, and determining the appropriate candidates for the next token is crucial to ensure generation quality. This study introduces adaptive decoding, a mechanism that dynamically empowers language models to ascertain a sensible candidate set during generation. Specifically, we introduce an entropy-based metric called confidence and conceptualize determining the optimal candidate set as a confidence-increasing process. The rationality of including a token in the candidate set is assessed by leveraging the increment of confidence. Experimental results reveal that our method balances diversity and coherence well. The human evaluation shows that our method can generate human-preferred text. Additionally, our method can potentially improve the reasoning ability of language models."}
{"title": "On the Embedding Collapse when Scaling up Recommendation Models", "abstract": "Recent advances in foundation models have led to a promising trend of developing large recommendation models to leverage vast amounts of available data. Still, mainstream models remain embarrassingly small in size and naive enlarging does not lead to sufficient performance gain, suggesting a deficiency in the model scalability. In this paper, we identify the embedding collapse phenomenon as the inhibition of scalability, wherein the embedding matrix tends to occupy a low-dimensional subspace. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate a two-sided effect of feature interaction specific to recommendation models. On the one hand, interacting with collapsed embeddings restricts embedding learning and exacerbates the collapse issue. On the other hand, interaction is crucial in mitigating the fitting of spurious features as a scalability guarantee. Based on our analysis, we propose a simple yet effective multi-embedding design incorporating embedding-set-specific interaction modules to learn embedding sets with large diversity and thus reduce collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this proposed design provides consistent scalability and effective collapse mitigation for various recommendation models.

While ECG Self-supervised Learning (eSSL) methods show promise in representation learning from unannotated ECG data, they often overlook the clinical knowledge that can be found in reports. This oversight and the requirement for annotated samples for downstream tasks limit eSSL's versatility. In this work, we address these issues with the **M**ultimodal **E**CG **R**epresentation **L**earning (**MERL**) framework. Through multimodal learning on ECG records and associated reports, MERL is capable of performing zero-shot ECG classification with text prompts, eliminating the need for training data in downstream tasks. At test time, we propose the **C**linical **K**nowledge **E**nhanced **P**rompt **E**ngineering (**CKEPE**) approach, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to exploit external expert-verified clinical knowledge databases, generating more descriptive prompts and reducing hallucinations in LLM-generated content to boost zero-shot classification. Based on MERL, we perform the first benchmark across six public ECG datasets, showing the superior performance of MERL compared against eSSL methods. Notably, MERL achieves an average AUC score of 75.2% in zero-shot classification (**without training data**), 3.2% higher than linear probed eSSL methods with 10% annotated training data, averaged across all six datasets."}

Despite numerous attempts to protect DMs from copyright issues, the vulnerabilities of these solutions are underexplored. In this study, we formalized the Copyright Infringement Attack on generative AI models and proposed a backdoor attack method, SilentBadDiffusion, to induce copyright infringement without requiring access to or control over training processes. Our method strategically embeds connections between pieces of copyrighted information and text references in poisoning data while carefully dispersing that information, making the poisoning data inconspicuous when integrated into a clean dataset. Our experiments show the stealth and efficacy of the poisoning data. When given specific text prompts, DMs trained with a poisoning ratio of 0.20% can produce copyrighted images. Additionally, the results reveal that the more sophisticated the DMs are, the easier the success of the attack becomes. These findings underline potential pitfalls in the prevailing copyright protection strategies and underscore the necessity for increased scrutiny to prevent the misuse of DMs."}
{"title": "Bridging Environments and Language with Rendering Functions and Vision-Language Models", "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have tremendous potential for *grounding* language, and thus enabling *language-conditioned agents (LCAs)* to perform diverse tasks specified with text. This has motivated the study of LCAs based on reinforcement learning (RL) with rewards given by rendering images of an environment and evaluating those images with VLMs. If single-task RL is employed, such approaches are limited by the cost and time required to train a policy for each new task. Multi-task RL (MTRL) is a natural alternative, but requires a carefully designed corpus of training tasks and does not always generalize reliably to new tasks. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel decomposition of the problem of building an LCA: first find an *environment configuration* that has a high VLM score for text describing a task; then use a (pretrained) goal-conditioned policy to reach that configuration. We also explore several enhancements to the speed and quality of VLM-based LCAs, notably, the use of distilled models, and the evaluation of configurations from multiple viewpoints to resolve the ambiguities inherent in a single 2D view. We demonstrate our approach on the Humanoid environment, showing that it results in LCAs that outperform MTRL baselines in zero-shot generalization, without requiring any textual task descriptions or other forms of environment-specific annotation during training."}
{"title": "Fast-Slow Test-Time Adaptation for Online Vision-and-Language Navigation", "abstract": "The ability to accurately comprehend natural language instructions and navigate to the target location is essential for an embodied agent. Such agents are typically required to execute user instructions in an online manner, leading us to explore the use of unlabeled test samples for effective online model adaptation. However, for online Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), due to the intrinsic nature of inter-sample online instruction execution and intra-sample multi-step action decision, frequent updates can result in drastic changes in model parameters, while occasional updates can make the model ill-equipped to handle dynamically changing environments. Therefore, we propose a Fast-Slow Test-Time Adaptation (FSTTA) approach for online VLN by performing joint decomposition-accumulation analysis for both gradients and parameters in a unified framework. Extensive experiments show that our method obtains impressive performance gains on four popular benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/Feliciaxyao/ICML2024-FSTTA."}

By removing carefully chosen structures, e.g., neurons or attention heads, the improvements from this approach can be realized on standard deep learning hardware. In this work, we focus on structured pruning in the one-shot (post-training) setting, which does not require model retraining after pruning. We propose a novel combinatorial optimization framework for this problem, based on a layer-wise reconstruction objective and a careful reformulation that allows for scalable optimization. Moreover, we design a new local combinatorial optimization algorithm, which exploits low-rank updates for efficient local search. Our framework is time and memory-efficient and considerably improves upon state-of-the-art one-shot methods on vision models (e.g., ResNet50, MobileNet) and language models (e.g., OPT-1.3B -- OPT-30B). For language models, e.g., OPT-2.7B, OSSCAR can lead to $125\\times$ lower test perplexity on WikiText with $2\\times$ inference time speedup in comparison to the state-of-the-art ZipLM approach. Our framework is also $6\\times$ -- $8\\times$ faster.

{"title": "Getting the most out of your tokenizer for pre-training and domain adaptation", "abstract": "Tokenization is an understudied and often neglected component of modern LLMs. Most published works use a single tokenizer for all experiments, often borrowed from another model, without performing ablations or analysis to optimize tokenization. Moreover, the tokenizer is generally kept unchanged when fine-tuning a base model. In this paper, we show that the size, pre-tokenization regular expression, and training data of a tokenizer can significantly impact the model's generation speed, effective context size, memory usage, and downstream performance. We train specialized Byte-Pair Encoding code tokenizers, and conduct extensive ablations on the impact of tokenizer design on the performance of LLMs for code generation tasks such as HumanEval and MBPP, and provide recommendations for tokenizer hyper-parameters selection and switching the tokenizer in a pre-trained LLM. We perform our experiments on models trained from scratch and from pre-trained models, verifying their applicability to a wide range of use-cases. We find that when fine-tuning on more than 50 billion tokens, we can specialize the tokenizer of a pre-trained LLM to obtain large gains in generation speed and effective context size."}

In order to enhance visual comprehension, recent studies have equipped LMMs with region-level understanding capabilities by representing object bounding box coordinates as a series of text sequences (pix2seq). In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm for object location modeling called the pix2emb method, where we ask the LMM to output the location embeddings and then decode them with different decoders. This paradigm allows us to use different location formats (such as bounding boxes and masks) in multimodal conversations. Leveraging the proposed pix2emb method, we train an LMM named NExT-Chat and demonstrate its capability of handling multiple tasks like visual grounding, region captioning, and grounded reasoning. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of our NExT-Chat on various tasks, e.g., NExT-Chat (87.7) vs. Shikra (86.9) on POPE-Random, NExT-Chat (71.3) vs. LISA (67.9) on referring expression segmentation task, and NExT-Chat (79.6) vs. Kosmos-2 (62.3) on region caption task."}

Large Language Models (LLM) contain valuable task-related knowledge that can potentially aid in the learning of reward functions. However, the proposed reward function can be imprecise, thus ineffective which requires to be further grounded with environment information. We proposed a method to learn rewards more efficiently in the absence of humans. Our approach consists of two components: We first use the LLM to propose features and parameterization of the reward, then update the parameters through an iterative self-alignment process. In particular, the process minimizes the ranking inconsistency between the LLM and the learnt reward functions based on the execution feedback. The method was validated on 9 tasks across 2 simulation environments. It demonstrates a consistent improvement in training efficacy and efficiency, meanwhile consuming significantly fewer GPT tokens compared to the alternative mutation-based method."}

First, models discriminate audio with a combination of basic acoustic features rather than high-level abstract concepts. Second, training strategies affect neuron behaviors. Supervised training guides neurons to gradually narrow their attention, while self-supervised learning encourages neurons to be polysemantic for exploring high-level features. Finally, we demonstrate a potential use of *AND* in audio model unlearning by conducting concept-specific pruning based on the descriptions."}

In this work, we introduce round-trip correctness (RTC) as an alternative evaluation method. RTC allows Code LLM evaluation on a broader spectrum of real-world software domains without the need for costly human curation. RTC rests on the idea that we can ask a model to make a prediction (e.g., describe some code using natural language), feed that prediction back (e.g., synthesize code from the predicted description), and check if this round-trip leads to code that is semantically equivalent to the original input. We show how to employ RTC to evaluate code synthesis and editing. We find that RTC strongly correlates with model performance on existing narrow-domain code synthesis benchmarks while allowing us to expand to a much broader set of domains and tasks which was not previously possible without costly human annotations."}

The transferable representations and remarkable generalization capacity of VLM make them highly compatible with the integration of federated learning. Addressing data heterogeneity in federated learning requires personalization, but excessive focus on it across clients could compromise the model's ability to generalize effectively. To preserve the impressive generalization capability of VLM, it is crucial to strike a balance between personalization and generalization in FPL. To tackle this challenge, we proposed Federated Prompt Learning with CLIP Generalization and low-rank Personalization (FedPGP), which employs pre-trained CLIP to provide knowledge-guidance on the global prompt for improved generalization and incorporates a low-rank adaptation term to personalize the global prompt. Further, FedPGP integrates a prompt-wise contrastive loss to achieve knowledge guidance and personalized adaptation simultaneously, enabling a harmonious balance between personalization and generalization in FPL. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to explore base-to-novel generalization in both category-level and domain-level scenarios with heterogeneous data, showing the superiority of FedPGP in balancing generalization and personalization."}

A significant question remains: `` Is it viable to learn a neural network to predict a personalized temperature of any input data for enhancing LFMs?\" In this paper, we present a principled framework for learning a small yet generalizable temperature prediction network (TempNet) to improve LFMs. Our solution is composed of a novel learning framework with robust losses underpinned by constrained distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and a properly designed TempNet with theoretical inspiration. TempNet can be trained together with a large foundation model from scratch or learned separately given a pretrained foundation model. It is not only useful for predicting personalized temperature to promote the training of LFMs but also generalizable and transferable to new tasks.

In this paper, we propose RL-VLM-F, a method that automatically generates reward functions for agents to learn new tasks, using only a text description of the task goal and the agent's visual observations, by leveraging feedbacks from vision language foundation models (VLMs). The key to our approach is to query these models to give preferences over pairs of the agent's image observations based on the text description of the task goal, and then learn a reward function from the preference labels, rather than directly prompting these models to output a raw reward score, which can be noisy and inconsistent. We demonstrate that RL-VLM-F successfully produces effective rewards and policies across various domains — including classic control, as well as manipulation of rigid, articulated, and deformable objects — without the need for human supervision, outperforming prior methods that use large pretrained models for reward generation under the same assumptions.

{"title": "Interpretability Illusions in the Generalization of Simplified Models", "abstract": "A common method to study deep learning systems is to use simplified model representations—for example, using singular value decomposition to visualize the model’s hidden states in a lower dimensional space. This approach assumes that the results of these simplifications are faithful to the original model. Here, we illustrate an important caveat to this assumption: even if the simplified representations can accurately approximate the full model on the training set, they may fail to accurately capture the model’s behavior out of distribution. We illustrate this by training Transformer models on controlled datasets with systematic generalization splits, including the Dyck balanced-parenthesis languages and a code completion task. We simplify these models using tools like dimensionality reduction and clustering, and then explicitly test how these simplified proxies match the behavior of the original model. We find consistent generalization gaps: cases in which the simplified proxies are more faithful to the original model on the in-distribution evaluations and less faithful on various tests of systematic generalization. This includes cases where the original model generalizes systematically but the simplified proxies fail, and cases where the simplified proxies generalize better. Together, our results raise questions about the extent to which mechanistic interpretations derived using tools like SVD can reliably predict what a model will do in novel situations."}
{"title": "Nash Learning from Human Feedback", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the main paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Traditionally, RLHF involves the initial step of learning a reward model from pairwise human feedback, i.e., expressed as preferences between pairs of text generations. Subsequently, the LLM's policy is fine-tuned to maximize the reward through a reinforcement learning algorithm. In this study, we introduce an alternative pipeline for the fine-tuning of LLMs using pairwise human feedback. Our approach entails the initial learning of a pairwise preference model, which is conditioned on two inputs (instead of a single input in the case of a reward model) given a prompt, followed by the pursuit of a policy that consistently generates responses preferred over those generated by any competing policy, thus defining the Nash equilibrium of this preference model. We term this approach Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). In the context of a tabular policy representation, we present a novel algorithmic solution, Nash-MD, founded on the principles of mirror descent. This algorithm produces a sequence of policies, with the last iteration converging to the regularized Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we explore parametric representations of policies and introduce gradient descent algorithms for deep-learning architectures. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by presenting experimental results on a text summarization task. We believe NLHF offers a compelling avenue for fine-tuning LLMs and enhancing the alignment of LLMs with human preferences."}

In this work, we introduce *Linear Alignment*, a novel algorithm that aligns language models with human preferences in one single inference step, eliminating the reliance on data annotation and model training. Linear alignment incorporates a new parameterization for policy optimization under divergence constraints, which enables the extraction of optimal policy in a closed-form manner and facilitates the direct estimation of the aligned response. Extensive experiments on both general and personalized preference datasets demonstrate that linear alignment significantly enhances the performance and efficiency of LLM alignment across diverse scenarios."}

In this paper, we focus on the trustworthiness of language models with respect to retrieval augmentation.

We deem that retrieval-augmented language models have the inherent capabilities of supplying response according to both contextual and parametric knowledge. Inspired by aligning language models with human preference, we take the first step towards aligning retrieval-augmented language models to a status where it responds relying merely on the external evidence and disregards the interference of parametric knowledge. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning based algorithm Trustworthy-Alignment, theoretically and experimentally demonstrating large language models' capability of reaching a trustworthy status without explicit supervision on how to respond. Our work highlights the potential of large language models on exploring its intrinsic abilities by its own and expands the application scenarios of alignment from fulfilling human preference to creating trustworthy agents."}
{"title": "A Closer Look at the Limitations of Instruction Tuning", "abstract": "Instruction Tuning (IT), the process of training large language models (LLMs) using instruction-response pairs, has emerged as the predominant method for transforming base pre-trained LLMs into open-domain conversational agents. While IT has achieved notable success and widespread adoption, its limitations and shortcomings remain underexplored. In this paper, through rigorous experiments and an in-depth analysis of the changes LLMs undergo through IT, we reveal various limitations of IT. In particular, we show that (1) IT fails to enhance knowledge or skills in LLMs. LoRA fine-tuning is limited to learning response initiation and style tokens, and full-parameter fine-tuning leads to knowledge degradation. (2) Copying response patterns from IT datasets derived from knowledgeable sources leads to a decline in response quality. (3) Full-parameter fine-tuning increases hallucination by inaccurately borrowing tokens from conceptually similar instances in the IT dataset for generating responses. (4) Popular methods to improve IT do not lead to performance improvements over a simple LoRA fine-tuned model. Our findings reveal that responses generated solely from pre-trained knowledge consistently outperform responses by models that learn any form of new knowledge from IT on open-source datasets.

{"title": "Magicoder: Empowering Code Generation with OSS-Instruct", "abstract": "We introduce Magicoder, a series of fully open-source (code, weights, and data) Large Language Models (LLMs) for code that significantly closes the gap with top code models while having no more than 7B parameters. Magicoder models are trained on 75K synthetic instruction data using **OSS-Instruct**, a novel approach to enlightening LLMs with open-source code snippets to generate diverse instruction data for code. Our main motivation is to mitigate the inherent bias of the synthetic data generated by LLMs through the wealth of open-source references for the production of more realistic and controllable data. The orthogonality of OSS-Instruct and other data generation methods like Evol-Instruct further enables us to build an enhanced MagicoderS. Both Magicoder and MagicoderS substantially outperform state-of-the-art code models with similar or even larger sizes on a wide range of coding benchmarks. Notably, MagicoderS-CL-7B based on CodeLlama even surpasses the prominent ChatGPT on HumanEval+ (66.5 vs. 65.9 in pass@1 ). Overall, OSS-Instruct opens a new direction for crafting diverse synthetic instruction data for code using abundant open-source references."}
{"title": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Discrete Fourier Transform", "abstract": "Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has recently gained much interest in fine-tuning foundation models. It effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters by incorporating low-rank matrices $A$ and $B$ to represent the weight change, i.e., $\\Delta W=BA$. Despite LoRA's progress, it faces storage challenges when handling extensive customization adaptations or larger base models. In this work, we aim to further compress trainable parameters by enjoying the powerful expressiveness of the Fourier transform. Specifically, we introduce FourierFT, which treats $\\Delta W$ as a matrix in the spatial domain and learns only a small fraction of its spectral coefficients. With the trained spectral coefficients, we implement the inverse discrete Fourier transform to recover $\\Delta W$. Empirically, our FourierFT method shows comparable or better performance with fewer parameters than LoRA on various tasks, including natural language understanding, natural language generation, instruction tuning, and image classification. For example, when performing instruction tuning on the LLaMA2-7B model, FourierFT surpasses LoRA with only 0.064M trainable parameters, compared to LoRA's 33.5M. Our code is released at [this link](https://github.com/Chaos96/fourierft)."}
{"title": "Fair Classification with Partial Feedback: An Exploration-Based Data Collection Approach", "abstract": "In many predictive contexts (e.g., credit lending), true outcomes are only observed for samples that were positively classified in the past. These past observations, in turn, form training datasets for classifiers that make future predictions. However, such training datasets lack information about the outcomes of samples that were (incorrectly) negatively classified in the past and can lead to erroneous classifiers. We present an approach that trains a classifier using available data and comes with a family of exploration strategies to collect outcome data about subpopulations that otherwise would have been ignored. For any exploration strategy, the approach comes with guarantees that (1) all sub-populations are explored, (2) the fraction of false positives is bounded, and (3) the trained classifier converges to a \"desired\" classifier. The right exploration strategy is context-dependent; it can be chosen to improve learning guarantees and encode context-specific group fairness properties. Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that this approach consistently boosts the quality of collected outcome data and improves the fraction of true positives for all groups, with only a small reduction in predictive utility."}
{"title": "Bounding the Excess Risk for Linear Models Trained on Marginal-Preserving, Differentially-Private, Synthetic Data", "abstract": "The growing use of machine learning (ML) has raised concerns that an ML model may reveal private information about an individual who has contributed to the training dataset. To prevent leakage of sensitive data, we consider using differentially- private (DP), synthetic training data instead of real training data to train an ML model. A key desirable property of synthetic data is its ability to preserve the low-order marginals of the original distribution. Our main contribution comprises novel upper and lower bounds on the excess empirical risk of linear models trained on such synthetic data, for continuous and Lipschitz loss functions. We perform extensive experimentation alongside our theoretical results."}
{"title": "Position: Cracking the Code of Cascading Disparity Towards Marginalized Communities", "abstract": "The rise of foundation models holds immense promise for advancing AI, but this progress may amplify existing risks and inequalities, leaving marginalized communities behind. In this position paper, we discuss that disparities towards marginalized communities – performance, representation, privacy, robustness, interpretability and safety – are not isolated concerns but rather interconnected elements of a cascading disparity phenomenon. We contrast foundation models with traditional models and highlight the potential for exacerbated disparity against marginalized communities. Moreover, we emphasize the unique threat of cascading impacts in foundation models, where interconnected disparities can trigger long-lasting negative consequences, specifically to the people on the margin. We define marginalized communities within the machine learning context and explore the multifaceted nature of disparities. We analyze the sources of these disparities, tracing them from data creation, training and deployment procedures to highlight the complex technical and socio-technical landscape. To mitigate the pressing crisis, we conclude with a set of calls to action to mitigate disparity at its source."}
{"title": "Sparse-IFT: Sparse Iso-FLOP Transformations for Maximizing Training Efficiency", "abstract": "Recent research has focused on weight sparsity in deep neural network training to reduce FLOPs, aiming for improved efficiency (test accuracy w.r.t training FLOPs). However, sparse weight training often compromises accuracy, requiring extended training schedules to attain the accuracy of dense models. In contrast, our approach, Sparse Iso-FLOP Transformations (Sparse-IFT), uses sparsity to improve accuracy while maintaining dense model FLOPs. Using a single hyperparameter (i.e., the sparsity level), Sparse-IFTs efficiently replace dense layers, expanding the search space for optimal sparse masks. In addition, dynamic sparse training (DST) with Sparse-IFT models effectively navigate this larger sparse mask-weight space, which is evidenced by a spectral analysis using Ramanujan graph properties. Our study reveals a robust correlation among mask topology, weights, and final performance. Notably, without adjusting any training hyperparameters, replacing dense layers with Sparse-IFT yields significant improvements, such as a +3.5% boost for ResNet-18 on ImageNet and +0.9% for GPT-3 Small on the Open LLM leaderboard. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the use of sparsity for improving the accuracy of dense models through a set of simple-to-use sparse transformations.

{"title": "Online Cascade Learning for Efficient Inference over Streams", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have a natural role in answering complex queries about data streams, but the high computational cost of LLM inference makes them infeasible in many such tasks. We propose *online cascade learning*, the first approach to address this challenge. The objective here is to learn a ``cascade'' of models, starting with lower-capacity models (such as logistic regression) and ending with a powerful LLM, along with a *deferral policy* that determines the model to be used on a given input. We formulate the task of learning cascades online as an imitation-learning problem, where smaller models are updated over time imitating the collected LLM demonstrations, and give a no-regret algorithm for the problem. Experimental results across four benchmarks show that our method parallels LLMs in accuracy while cutting down inference costs by as much as 90% with strong robustness against input distribution shifts, underscoring its efficacy and adaptability in stream processing.

{"title": "Exploring the LLM Journey from Cognition to Expression with Linear Representations", "abstract": "This paper presents an in-depth examination of the evolution and interplay of cognitive and expressive capabilities in large language models (LLMs), with a specific focus on Baichuan-7B and Baichuan-33B, an advanced bilingual (Chinese and English) LLM series. We define and explore the model's cognitive and expressive capabilities through linear representations across three critical phases: Pretraining, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Cognitive capability is defined as the quantity and quality of information conveyed by the neuron output vectors within the network, similar to the neural signal processing in human cognition. Expressive capability is defined as the model’s capability to produce word-level output. Our findings unveil a sequential development pattern, where cognitive abilities are largely established during Pretraining, whereas expressive abilities predominantly advance during SFT and RLHF. Statistical analyses confirm a significant correlation between the two capabilities, suggesting that cognitive capacity may limit expressive potential. The paper also explores the theoretical underpinnings of these divergent developmental trajectories and their connection to the LLMs' architectural design. Moreover, we evaluate various optimization-independent strategies, such as few-shot learning and repeated sampling, which bridge the gap between cognitive and expressive capabilities. This research reveals the potential connection between the hidden space and the output space, contributing valuable insights into the interpretability and controllability of their training processes."}
{"title": "Position: Do pretrained Transformers Learn In-Context by Gradient Descent?", "abstract": "The emergence of In-Context Learning (ICL) in LLMs remains a remarkable phenomenon that is partially understood. To explain ICL, recent studies have created theoretical connections to Gradient Descent (GD). We ask, do such connections hold up in actual pre-trained language models? We highlight the limiting assumptions in prior works that make their setup considerably different from the practical setup in which language models are trained. For example, their experimental verification uses *ICL objective* (training models explicitly for ICL), which differs from the emergent ICL in the wild. Furthermore, the theoretical hand-constructed weights used in these studies have properties that don't match those of real LLMs. We also look for evidence in real models. We observe that ICL and GD have different sensitivity to the order in which they observe demonstrations. Finally, we probe and compare the ICL vs. GD hypothesis in a natural setting. We conduct comprehensive empirical analyses on language models pre-trained on natural data (LLaMa-7B). Our comparisons of three performance metrics highlight the inconsistent behavior of ICL and GD as a function of various factors such as datasets, models, and the number of demonstrations. We observe that ICL and GD modify the output distribution of language models differently. These results indicate that *the equivalence between ICL and GD remains an open hypothesis* and calls for further studies."}
{"title": "Watermark Stealing in Large Language Models", "abstract": "LLM watermarking has attracted attention as a promising way to detect AI-generated content, with some works suggesting that current schemes may already be fit for deployment. In this work we dispute this claim, identifying *watermark stealing* (WS) as a fundamental vulnerability of these schemes. We show that querying the API of the watermarked LLM to approximately reverse-engineer a watermark enables practical *spoofing attacks*, as hypothesized in prior work, but also greatly boosts *scrubbing* attacks, which was previously unnoticed. We are the first to propose an automated WS algorithm and use it in the first comprehensive study of spoofing and scrubbing in realistic settings. We show that for under $50 an attacker can both spoof and scrub state-of-the-art schemes previously considered safe, with average success rate of over 80\\%. Our findings challenge common beliefs about LLM watermarking, stressing the need for more robust schemes. We make all our code and additional examples available at https://watermark-stealing.org."}

We introduce a series of training techniques, architecture design, and data strategies to enhance our model with these abilities.

{"title": "Iterative Data Smoothing: Mitigating Reward Overfitting and Overoptimization in RLHF", "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique that aligns language models closely with human-centric values. The initial phase of RLHF involves learning human values using a reward model from ranking data. It is observed that the performance of the reward model degrades after one epoch of training, and optimizing too much against the learned reward model eventually hinders the true objective. This paper analyzes potential reasons behind the issues, and designs improved reward learning algorithm termed 'Iterative Data Smoothing' (IDS). The core idea is that during each training epoch, we not only update the model with the data, but also update the date using the model, replacing hard labels with soft labels. Our empirical findings highlight the superior performance of this approach over the traditional methods."}
{"title": "One Size Fits All for Semantic Shifts: Adaptive Prompt Tuning for Continual Learning", "abstract": "In real-world continual learning (CL) scenarios, tasks often exhibit intricate and unpredictable semantic shifts, posing challenges for *fixed* prompt management strategies which are tailored to only handle semantic shifts of *uniform* degree (i.e., uniformly mild or uniformly abrupt). To address this limitation, we propose an *adaptive* prompting approach that effectively accommodates semantic shifts of *varying* degree where mild and abrupt shifts are mixed. AdaPromptCL employs the assign-and-refine semantic grouping mechanism that dynamically manages prompt groups in accordance with the semantic similarity between tasks, enhancing the quality of grouping through continuous refinement. Our experiment results demonstrate that AdaPromptCL outperforms existing prompting methods by up to 21.3%, especially in the benchmark datasets with diverse semantic shifts between tasks."}
{"title": "Gradient-based Visual Explanation for Transformer-based CLIP", "abstract": "Significant progress has been achieved on the improvement and downstream usages of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) vision-language model, while less attention is paid to the interpretation of CLIP. We propose a Gradient-based visual Explanation method for CLIP (Grad-ECLIP), which interprets the matching result of CLIP for specific input image-text pair. By decomposing the architecture of the encoder and discovering the relationship between the matching similarity and intermediate spatial features, Grad-ECLIP produces effective heat maps that show the influence of image regions or words on the CLIP results. Different from the previous Transformer interpretation methods that focus on the utilization of self-attention maps, which are typically extremely sparse in CLIP, we produce high-quality visual explanations by applying channel and spatial weights on token features. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations verify the superiority of Grad-ECLIP compared with the state-of-the-art methods. A series of analysis are conducted based on our visual explanation results, from which we explore the working mechanism of image-text matching, and the strengths and limitations in attribution identification of CLIP.

{"title": "Helpful or Harmful Data? Fine-tuning-free Shapley Attribution for Explaining Language Model Predictions", "abstract": "The increasing complexity of foundational models underscores the necessity for explainability, particularly for fine-tuning, the most widely used training method for adapting models to downstream tasks. Instance attribution, one type of explanation, attributes the model prediction to each training example by an instance score. However, the robustness of instance scores, specifically towards dataset resampling, has been overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose a notion of robustness on the sign of the instance score. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that the popular leave-one-out-based methods lack robustness, while the Shapley value behaves significantly better, but at a higher computational cost. Accordingly, we introduce an efficient fine-tuning-free approximation of the Shapley value (FreeShap) for instance attribution based on the neural tangent kernel. We empirically demonstrate that FreeShap outperforms other methods for instance attribution and other data-centric applications such as data removal, data selection, and wrong label detection, and further generalize our scale to large language models (LLMs). Our code is available at https://github.com/JTWang2000/FreeShap."}
{"title": "Why Larger Language Models Do In-context Learning Differently?", "abstract": "Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a powerful tool for AI, with the key ability of in-context learning (ICL), where they can perform well on unseen tasks based on a brief series of task examples without necessitating any adjustments to the model parameters. One recent interesting mysterious observation is that models of different scales may have different ICL behaviors: larger models tend to be more sensitive to noise in the test context. This work studies this observation theoretically aiming to improve the understanding of LLM and ICL. We analyze two stylized settings: (1) linear regression with one-layer single-head linear transformers and (2) parity classification with two-layer multiple attention heads transformers (non-linear data and non-linear model). In both settings, we give closed-form optimal solutions and find that smaller models emphasize important hidden features while larger ones cover more hidden features; thus, smaller models are more robust to noise while larger ones are more easily distracted, leading to different ICL behaviors. This sheds light on where transformers pay attention to and how that affects ICL. Preliminary experimental results on large base and chat models provide positive support for our analysis."}
{"title": "Robust CLIP: Unsupervised Adversarial Fine-Tuning of Vision Embeddings for Robust Large Vision-Language Models", "abstract": "Multi-modal foundation models like OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, and GPT-4 are increasingly used for various real-world tasks. Prior work has shown that these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks on the vision modality. These attacks can be leveraged to spread fake information or defraud users, and thus pose a significant risk, which makes the robustness of large multi-modal foundation models a pressing problem. The CLIP model, or one of its variants, is used as a frozen vision encoder in many large vision-language models (LVLMs), e.g. LLaVA and OpenFlamingo. We propose an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning scheme to obtain a robust CLIP vision encoder, which yields robustness on all vision down-stream tasks (LVLMs, zero-shot classification) that rely on CLIP. In particular, we show that stealth-attacks on users of LVLMs by a malicious third party providing manipulated images are no longer possible once one replaces the original CLIP model with our robust one. No retraining or fine-tuning of the down-stream LVLMs is required. The code and robust models are available on GitHub."}
{"title": "Language Models as Science Tutors", "abstract": "NLP has recently made exciting progress toward training language models (LMs) with strong scientific problem-solving skills. However, model development has not focused on real-life use-cases of LMs for science, including applications in education that require processing long scientific documents. To address this, we introduce TutorEval and TutorChat. TutorEval is a diverse question-answering benchmark consisting of questions about long chapters from STEM textbooks, written by experts. TutorEval helps measure real-life usability of LMs as scientific assistants, and it is the first benchmark combining long contexts, free-form generation, and multi-disciplinary scientific knowledge. Moreover, we show that fine-tuning base models with existing dialogue datasets leads to poor performance on TutorEval. Therefore, we create TutorChat, a dataset of 80,000 long synthetic dialogues about textbooks. We use TutorChat to fine-tune Llemma models with 7B and 34B parameters. These LM tutors specialized in math have a 32K-token context window, and they excel at TutorEval while performing strongly on GSM8K and MATH. Our datasets build on open-source materials, and we release our models, data, and evaluations publicly."}
{"title": "GistScore: Learning Better Representations for In-Context Example Selection with Gist Bottlenecks", "abstract": "In-Context Learning (ICL) is the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform new tasks when conditioned on prompts comprising a few task examples. However, ICL performance can be critically sensitive to the choice of examples. To dynamically select the best examples for every test input, we propose Example Gisting, a novel approach for training example encoders through supervised finetuning with an attention bottleneck between the inputs and outputs. These gist models form the basis for GistScore, a novel metric for scoring and selecting informative examples. Further, we experiment with two variations: (1) finetuning gist models for each dataset and (2) multi-task training a single model on a large collection of datasets. The latter can be used for new tasks out-of-the-box, enabling a training-free ICL pipeline. Evaluations with 21 datasets spanning 9 tasks and 8 diverse LLMs show that our fine-tuned models get state-of-the-art ICL performance with over 20% absolute gain over off-the-shelf retrievers and 5% over the best prior methods. Further, our multi-task model generalizes well to new tasks, datasets, and prompt templates. Selection using this model matches or outperforms prior methods while being three orders of magnitude faster than the strongest training-free baseline."}
{"title": "Prompting4Debugging: Red-Teaming Text-to-Image Diffusion Models by Finding Problematic Prompts", "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models, e.g. Stable Diffusion (SD), lately have shown remarkable ability in high-quality content generation, and become one of the representatives for the recent wave of transformative AI. Nevertheless, such advance comes with an intensifying concern about the misuse of this generative technology, especially for producing copyrighted or NSFW (i.e. not safe for work) images. Although efforts have been made to filter inappropriate images/prompts or remove undesirable concepts/styles via model fine-tuning, the reliability of these safety mechanisms against diversified problematic prompts remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose **Prompting4Debugging (P4D)** as a debugging and red-teaming tool that automatically finds problematic prompts for diffusion models to test the reliability of a deployed safety mechanism. We demonstrate the efficacy of our P4D tool in uncovering new vulnerabilities of SD models with safety mechanisms. Particularly, our result shows that around half of prompts in existing safe prompting benchmarks which were originally considered \"safe\" can actually be manipulated to bypass many deployed safety mechanisms, including concept removal, negative prompt, and safety guidance. Our findings suggest that, without comprehensive testing, the evaluations on limited safe prompting benchmarks can lead to a false sense of safety for text-to-image models."}
{"title": "BAGEL: Bootstrapping Agents by Guiding Exploration with Language", "abstract": "Following natural language instructions by executing actions in digital environments (e.g. web-browsers and REST APIs) is a challenging task for language model (LM) agents. Unfortunately, LM agents often fail to generalize to new environments without human demonstrations. This work presents BAGEL, a method for bootstrapping LM agents without human supervision. BAGEL converts a seed set of randomly explored trajectories to synthetic demonstrations via round-trips between two noisy LM components: an LM labeler which converts a trajectory into a synthetic instruction, and a zero-shot LM agent which maps the synthetic instruction into a refined trajectory. By performing these round-trips iteratively, BAGEL quickly converts the initial distribution of trajectories towards those that are well-described by natural language. We adapt the base LM agent at test time with in-context learning by retrieving relevant BAGEL demonstrations based on the instruction, and find improvements of over 2-13% absolute on ToolQA and MiniWob++, with up to 13x reduction in execution failures."}

Limits of LLM scaling based on human-generated data", "abstract": "We investigate the potential constraints on LLM scaling posed by the availability of public human-generated text data. We forecast the growing demand for training data based on current trends and estimate the total stock of public human text data. Our findings indicate that if current LLM development trends continue, models will be trained on datasets roughly equal in size to the available stock of public human text data between 2026 and 2032, or slightly earlier if models are overtrained. We explore how progress in language modeling can continue when human-generated text datasets cannot be scaled any further. We argue that synthetic data generation, transfer learning from data-rich domains, and data efficiency improvements might support further progress."}

By harnessing topological and semantic information, VoroNav designs text-based descriptions of paths and images that are readily interpretable by a large language model (LLM). In particular, our approach presents a synergy of path and farsight descriptions to represent the environmental context, enabling LLM to apply commonsense reasoning to ascertain waypoints for navigation. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and HSSD validates VoroNav surpasses existing benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +2.8% Success and +3.7% SPL on HM3D, +2.6% Success and +3.8% SPL on HSSD).

However, as LMs are scaled up, the memory requirements for backpropagation become prohibitively high. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization methods can leverage memory-efficient forward passes to estimate gradients. More recently, MeZO, an adaptation of ZO-SGD, has been shown to consistently outperform zero-shot and in-context learning when combined with suitable task prompts. In this work, we couple ZO methods with variance reduction techniques to enhance stability and convergence for inference-based LM fine-tuning. We introduce Memory-Efficient Zeroth-Order Stochastic Variance-Reduced Gradient (MeZO-SVRG) and demonstrate its efficacy across multiple LM fine-tuning tasks, eliminating the reliance on task-specific prompts. Evaluated across a range of both masked and autoregressive LMs on benchmark GLUE tasks, MeZO-SVRG outperforms MeZO with up to 20% increase in test accuracies in both full- and partial-parameter fine-tuning settings. MeZO-SVRG benefits from reduced computation time as it often surpasses MeZO's peak test accuracy with a $2\\times$ reduction in GPU-hours. MeZO-SVRG significantly reduces the required memory footprint compared to first-order SGD, i.e. by $2\\times$ for autoregressive models. Our experiments highlight that MeZO-SVRG's memory savings progressively improve compared to SGD with larger batch sizes."}

{"title": "An Embodied Generalist Agent in 3D World", "abstract": "Leveraging massive knowledge from large language models (LLMs), recent machine learning models show notable successes in general-purpose task solving in diverse domains such as computer vision and robotics. However, several significant challenges remain: (i) most of these models rely on 2D images yet exhibit a limited capacity for 3D input; (ii) these models rarely explore the tasks inherently defined in 3D world, e.g., 3D grounding, embodied reasoning and acting. We argue these limitations significantly hinder current models from performing real-world tasks and approaching general intelligence. To this end, we introduce LEO, an embodied multi-modal generalist agent that excels in perceiving, grounding, reasoning, planning, and acting in the 3D world. LEO is trained with a unified task interface, model architecture, and objective in two stages: (i) 3D vision-language (VL) alignment and (ii) 3D vision-language-action (VLA) instruction tuning. We collect large-scale datasets comprising diverse object-level and scene-level tasks, which require considerable understanding of and interaction with the 3D world. Moreover, we meticulously design an LLM-assisted pipeline to produce high-quality 3D VL data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate LEO's remarkable proficiency across a wide spectrum of tasks, including 3D captioning, question answering, embodied reasoning, navigation and manipulation.

{"title": "The Linear Representation Hypothesis and the Geometry of Large Language Models", "abstract": "Informally, the \"linear representation hypothesis\" is the idea that high-level concepts are represented linearly as directions in some representation space. In this paper, we address two closely related questions: What does \"linear representation\" actually mean? And, how do we make sense of geometric notions (e.g., cosine similarity and projection) in the representation space? To answer these, we use the language of counterfactuals to give two formalizations of linear representation, one in the output (word) representation space, and one in the input (context) space. We then prove that these connect to linear probing and model steering, respectively. To make sense of geometric notions, we use the formalization to identify a particular (non-Euclidean) inner product that respects language structure in a sense we make precise. Using this *causal inner product*, we show how to unify all notions of linear representation. In particular, this allows the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of linear representations of concepts, the connection to interpretation and control, and the fundamental role of the choice of inner product."}
{"title": "Auto-Encoding Morph-Tokens for Multimodal LLM", "abstract": "For multimodal LLMs, the synergy of visual comprehension (textual output) and generation (visual output) presents an ongoing challenge. This is due to a conflicting objective: for comprehension, an MLLM needs to abstract the visuals; for generation, it needs to preserve the visuals as much as possible. Thus, the objective is a dilemma for visual-tokens. To resolve the conflict, we propose encoding images into morph-tokens to serve a dual purpose: for comprehension, they act as visual prompts instructing MLLM to generate texts; for generation, they take on a different, non-conflicting role as complete visual-tokens for image reconstruction, where the missing visual cues are recovered by the MLLM. Extensive experiments show that morph-tokens can achieve a new SOTA for multimodal comprehension and generation simultaneously. Our project is available at https://github.com/DCDmllm/MorphTokens."}

We will also argue that LLMs should be viewed as universal approximate knowledge sources that have much more meaningful roles to play in planning/reasoning tasks beyond simple front-end/back-end format translators. We present a vision of LLM-Modulo Frameworks that combine the strengths of LLMs with external model-based verifiers in a tighter bi-directional interaction regime. We will show how the models driving the external verifiers themselves can be acquired with the help of LLMs. We will also argue that rather than simply pipelining LLMs and symbolic components, this LLM-Modulo Framework provides a better neuro-symbolic approach that offers tighter integration between LLMs and symbolic components, and allows extending the scope of model-based planning/reasoning regimes towards more flexible knowledge, problem and preference specifications."}
{"title": "Data Engineering for Scaling Language Models to 128K Context", "abstract": "We study continual pretraining recipe for scaling language models' context lengths to 128K, with a focus on data engineering. We hypothesize that long context modeling, in particular *the ability to utilize information at arbitrary input locations*, is a capability that is mostly already acquired through large-scale pretraining, and that this capability can be readily extended to contexts substantially longer than seen during training (e.g., 4K to 128K) through lightweight continual pretraining on appropriate data mixture. We investigate the *quantity* and *quality* of the data for continual pretraining: (1) for quantity, we show that 500 million to 5 billion tokens are enough to enable the model to retrieve information anywhere within the 128K context; (2) for quality, our results equally emphasize *domain balance* and *length upsampling*. Concretely, naïvely upsampling longer data on certain domains like books, a common practice of existing work, gives suboptimal performance; a balanced domain mixture is equally important. We demonstrate that continual pretraining of the full model on 1B-5B tokens of such data is an effective and affordable strategy for scaling the context length of language models to 128K.

While speculative (Leviathan et al., 2023) and parallel (Stern et al., 2018) decoding techniques attempt to mitigate this, they face limitations: either relying on less accurate smaller models for generation or failing to fully leverage the base LLM's representations. We introduce a novel architecture, Tandem transformers, to address these issues. This architecture uniquely combines (1) a small autoregressive model and (2) a large model operating in block mode (processing multiple tokens simultaneously). The small model's predictive accuracy is substantially enhanced by granting it attention to the large model's richer representations. On the PaLM2 pretraining dataset, a tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko demonstrates a 3.3% improvement in next-token prediction accuracy over a standalone PaLM2-Gecko, offering a 1.16x speedup compared to a PaLM2-Otter model with comparable downstream performance. We further incorporate the Tandem model within the speculative decoding (SPEED) framework where the large model validates tokens from the small model. This ensures that the tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko achieves substantial speedup (around 1.14x faster than using vanilla PaLM2-Gecko in SPEED) while maintaining identical downstream task accuracy."}
{"title": "diff History for Neural Language Agents", "abstract": "Neural Language Models (LMs) offer an exciting solution for general-purpose embodied control. However, a key technical issue arises when using an LM-based controller: environment observations must be converted to text, which coupled with history, results in long and verbose textual prompts. As a result, prior work in LM agents is limited to restricted domains with small observation size as well as minimal needs for interaction history or instruction finetuning. In this paper, we introduce diff history, a simple and highly effective solution to these issues. By applying the Unix diff command on consecutive text observations in the interaction histories used to prompt LM policies, we can both abstract away redundant information and focus the content of textual inputs on the salient changes in the environment. On NetHack, an unsolved video game that requires long-horizon reasoning for decision-making, LMs tuned with diff history match state-of-the-art performance for neural agents while needing 1800X fewer training examples compared to prior work. Even on the simpler BabyAI-Text environment with concise text observations, we find that although diff history increases the length of prompts, the representation it provides offers a 25% improvement in the efficiency of low-sample instruction finetuning. Further, we show that diff history scales favorably across different finetuning dataset sizes. We open-source our code and data to https://diffhistory.github.io."}
{"title": "Revisiting Zeroth-Order Optimization for Memory-Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning: A Benchmark", "abstract": "In the evolving landscape of natural language processing (NLP), fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with first-order (FO) optimizers like SGD and Adam has become standard. Yet, as LLMs grow in size, the substantial memory overhead from back-propagation (BP) for FO gradient computation presents a significant challenge. Addressing this issue is crucial, especially for applications like on-device training where memory efficiency is paramount. This paper proposes a shift towards BP-free, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization as a solution for reducing memory costs during LLM fine-tuning, building on the initial concept introduced by (Malladi et al., 2023). Unlike traditional ZO-SGD methods, ou让work expands the exploration to a wider array of ZO optimization techniques, through a comprehensive, first-of-its-kind benchmarking study across five LLM families, three task complexities, and five fine-tuning schemes. Our study unveils previously overlooked optimization principles, highlighting the importance of task alignment, the role of the forward gradient method, and the balance between algorithm complexity and fine-tuning performance. We further introduce novel enhancements to ZO optimization, including block-wise descent, hybrid training, and gradient sparsity. Our study offers a promising direction for achieving further memory-efficient LLM fine-tuning. Codes to reproduce all our experiments will be made public."}
{"title": "ReMax: A Simple, Effective, and Efficient Reinforcement Learning Method for Aligning Large Language Models", "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is key to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), typically paired with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. While PPO is a powerful method designed for general reinforcement learning tasks, it is overly sophisticated for LLMs, leading to laborious hyper-parameter tuning and significant computation burdens. To make RLHF efficient, we present ReMax, which leverages 3 properties of RLHF: fast simulation, deterministic transitions, and trajectory-level rewards. These properties are not exploited in PPO, making it less suitable for RLHF. Building on the renowned REINFORCE algorithm, ReMax does not require training an additional value model as in PPO and is further enhanced with a new variance reduction technique. ReMax offers several benefits over PPO: it is simpler to implement, eliminates more than 4 hyper-parameters in PPO, reduces GPU memory usage, and shortens training time. ReMax can save about 46% GPU memory than PPO when training a 7B model and enables training on A800-80GB GPUs without the memory-saving offloading technique needed by PPO. Applying ReMax to a Mistral-7B model resulted in a 94.78% win rate on the AlpacaEval leaderboard and a 7.739 score on MT-bench, setting a new SOTA for open-source 7B models. These results show the effectiveness of ReMax while addressing the limitations of PPO in LLMs."}
{"title": "A Fresh Take on Stale Embeddings: Improving Dense Retriever Training with Corrector Networks", "abstract": "In dense retrieval, deep encoders provide embeddings for both inputs and targets, and the softmax function is used to parameterize a distribution over a large number of candidate targets (e.g., textual passages for information retrieval). Significant challenges arise in training such encoders in the increasingly prevalent scenario of (1) a large number of targets, (2) a computationally expensive target encoder model, (3) cached target embeddings that are out-of-date due to ongoing training of target encoder parameters. This paper presents a simple and highly scalable response to these challenges by training a small parametric _corrector network_ that adjusts stale cached target embeddings, enabling an accurate softmax approximation and thereby sampling of up-to-date high scoring \"hard negatives.\" We theoretically investigate the generalization properties of our proposed target corrector, relating the complexity of the network, staleness of cached representations, and the amount of training data. We present experimental results on large benchmark dense retrieval datasets as well as on QA with retrieval augmented language models. Our approach matches state-of-the-art results even when no target embedding updates are made during training beyond an initial cache from the unsupervised pre-trained model, providing a 4-80x reduction in re-embedding computational cost."}

{"title": "CodeIt: Self-Improving Language Models with Prioritized Hindsight Replay", "abstract": "Large language models are increasingly solving tasks that are commonly believed to require human-level reasoning ability. However, these models still perform very poorly on benchmarks of general intelligence such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this paper, we approach the ARC as a programming-by-examples problem, and introduce a novel and scalable method for language model self-improvement called Code Iteration (CodeIt). Our method iterates between 1) program sampling and hindsight relabeling, and 2) learning from prioritized experience replay. By relabeling the goal of an episode (i.e., the program output given input) to the output actually produced by the sampled program, our method effectively deals with the extreme sparsity of rewards in program synthesis. Applying CodeIt to the ARC dataset, we demonstrate that prioritized hindsight replay, along with pre-training and data-augmentation, leads to successful inter-task generalization. CodeIt is the first neuro-symbolic approach that scales to the full ARC evaluation dataset. Our method solves 15% of ARC evaluation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming existing neural and symbolic baselines.

Compared to static images, video poses unique challenges for effective large-scale pre-training due to the modeling of its spatiotemporal dynamics. In this paper, we address such limitations in video-language pre-training with an efficient video decomposition that represents each video as keyframes and temporal motions. These are then adapted to an LLM using well-designed tokenizers that discretize visual and temporal information as a few tokens, thus enabling unified generative pre-training of videos, images, and text. At inference, the generated tokens from the LLM are carefully recovered to the original continuous pixel space to create various video content. Our proposed framework is both capable of comprehending and generating image and video content, as demonstrated by its competitive performance across 13 multimodal benchmarks in image and video understanding and generation.

Central to our approach is that we reconceive time-series forecasting as a self-supervised, multi-patch prediction task, which, compared to traditional mask-and-reconstruction methods, captures temporal dynamics in patch representations more effectively. Our strategy encompasses two-stage training: (i). a causal continual pre-training phase on various time-series datasets, anchored on next patch prediction, effectively syncing LLM capabilities with the intricacies of time-series data; (ii). fine-tuning for multi-patch prediction in the targeted time-series context. A distinctive element of our framework is the patch-wise decoding layer, which departs from previous methods reliant on sequence-level decoding. Such a design directly transposes individual patches into temporal sequences, thereby significantly bolstering the model's proficiency in mastering temporal patch-based representations. $\\text{aL\\small{LM}4T\\small{S}}$ demonstrates superior performance in several downstream tasks, proving its effectiveness in deriving temporal representations with enhanced transferability and marking a pivotal advancement in the adaptation of LLMs for time-series analysis."}

{"title": "Learning and Forgetting Unsafe Examples in Large Language Models", "abstract": "As the number of large language models (LLMs) released to the public grows, there is a pressing need to understand the safety implications associated with these models learning from third-party custom finetuning data. We explore the behavior of LLMs finetuned on noisy custom data containing unsafe content, represented by datasets that contain biases, toxicity, and harmfulness, finding that while aligned LLMs can readily learn this unsafe content, they also tend to forget it more significantly than other examples when subsequently finetuned on safer content. Drawing inspiration from the discrepancies in forgetting, we introduce the “ForgetFilter” algorithm, which filters unsafe data based on how strong the model's forgetting signal is for that data. We demonstrate that the ForgetFilter algorithm ensures safety in customized finetuning without compromising downstream task performance, unlike sequential safety finetuning. ForgetFilter outperforms alternative strategies like replay and moral self-correction in curbing LLMs’ ability to assimilate unsafe content during custom finetuning, e.g. 75% lower than not applying any safety measures and 62% lower than using self-correction in toxicity score."}
{"title": "Use Your INSTINCT: INSTruction optimization for LLMs usIng Neural bandits Coupled with Transformers", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable instruction-following capabilities and achieved impressive performances in various applications. However, the performances of LLMs depend heavily on the instructions given to them, which are typically manually tuned with substantial human efforts. Recent work has used the query-efficient Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm to automatically optimize the instructions given to black-box LLMs. However, BO usually falls short when optimizing highly sophisticated (e.g., high-dimensional) objective functions, such as the functions mapping an instruction to the performance of an LLM. This is mainly due to the limited expressive power of the Gaussian process (GP) which is used by BO as a surrogate to model the objective function. Meanwhile, it has been repeatedly shown that neural networks (NNs), especially pre-trained transformers, possess strong expressive power and can model highly complex functions. So, we adopt a neural bandit algorithm which replaces the GP in BO by an NN surrogate to optimize instructions for black-box LLMs. More importantly, the neural bandit algorithm allows us to naturally couple the NN surrogate with the hidden representation learned by a pre-trained transformer (i.e., an open-source LLM), which significantly boosts its performance. These motivate us to propose our INSTruction optimization usIng Neural bandits Coupled with Transformers (INSTINCT) algorithm. We perform instruction optimization for ChatGPT and use extensive experiments to show that INSTINCT consistently outperforms baselines in different tasks, e.g., various instruction induction tasks and the task of improving zero-shot chain-of-thought instructions.

The key insight behind is to colocate LLMs considering their popularity to multiplex memory resources, and leverage the characteristics of prefill and decoding phases to separate and flexibly colocate them to multiplex computation resources. MuxServe formally formulates the multiplexing problem, and proposes a novel placement algorithm and adaptive batch scheduling strategy to identify optimal colocations and maximize utilization.

{"title": "A Bias-Variance-Covariance Decomposition of Kernel Scores for Generative Models", "abstract": "Generative models, like large language models, are becoming increasingly relevant in our daily lives, yet a theoretical framework to assess their generalization behavior and uncertainty does not exist. Particularly, the problem of uncertainty estimation is commonly solved in an ad-hoc and task-dependent manner. For example, natural language approaches cannot be transferred to image generation. In this paper, we introduce the first bias-variance-covariance decomposition for kernel scores. This decomposition represents a theoretical framework from which we derive a kernel-based variance and entropy for uncertainty estimation. We propose unbiased and consistent estimators for each quantity which only require generated samples but not the underlying model itself. Based on the wide applicability of kernels, we demonstrate our framework via generalization and uncertainty experiments for image, audio, and language generation. Specifically, kernel entropy for uncertainty estimation is more predictive of performance on CoQA and TriviaQA question answering datasets than existing baselines and can also be applied to closed-source models."}
{"title": "The Illusion of State in State-Space Models", "abstract": "State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as a potential alternative architecture for building large language models (LLMs) compared to the previously ubiquitous transformer architecture. One theoretical weakness of transformers is that they cannot express certain kinds of sequential computation and state tracking (Merrill & Sabharwal, 2023), which SSMs are explicitly designed to address via their close architectural similarity to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). *But do SSMs truly have an advantage (over transformers) in expressive power for state tracking?* Surprisingly, the answer is no. Our analysis reveals that the expressive power of SSMs is limited very similarly to transformers: SSMs cannot express computation outside the complexity class $\\mathsf{TC}^0$. In particular, this means they cannot solve simple state-tracking problems like permutation composition. It follows that SSMs are provably unable to accurately track chess moves with certain notation, evaluate code, or track entities in a long narrative. To supplement our formal analysis, we report experiments showing that Mamba-style SSMs indeed struggle with state tracking. Thus, despite its recurrent formulation, the \"state'' in an SSM is an illusion: SSMs have similar expressiveness limitations to non-recurrent models like transformers, which may fundamentally limit their ability to solve real-world state-tracking problems."}

Hence, this paper explores DoraemonGPT, a comprehensive and conceptually elegant system driven by LLMs to understand dynamic scenes. Considering the video modality better reflects the ever-changing nature of real-world scenarios, we exemplify DoraemonGPT as a video agent. Given a video with a question/task, DoraemonGPT begins by converting the input video into a symbolic memory that stores task-related attributes. This structured representation allows for spatial-temporal querying and reasoning by well-designed sub-task tools, resulting in concise intermediate results. Recognizing that LLMs have limited internal knowledge when it comes to specialized domains (e.g., analyzing the scientific principles underlying experiments), we incorporate plug-and-play tools to assess external knowledge and address tasks across different domains. Moreover, a novel LLM-driven planner based on Monte Carlo Tree Search is introduced to explore the large planning space for scheduling various tools. The planner iteratively finds feasible solutions by backpropagating the result's reward, and multiple solutions can be summarized into an improved final answer. We extensively evaluate DoraemonGPT's effectiveness on three benchmarks and several in-the-wild scenarios. Project page: https://z-x-yang.github.io/doraemon-gpt."}

However, it is generally costly and unstable to fine-tune large foundation models using reinforcement learning (RL), and the multi-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and conflicting nature of human preferences further complicate the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Rewards-in-Context (RiC), which conditions the response of a foundation model on multiple rewards in its prompt context and applies supervised fine-tuning for alignment. The salient features of RiC are simplicity and adaptivity, as it only requires supervised fine-tuning of a single foundation model and supports dynamic adjustment for user preferences during inference time. Inspired by the analytical solution of an abstracted convex optimization problem, our dynamic inference-time adjustment method approaches the Pareto-optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical evidence demonstrates the efficacy of our method in aligning both Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models to accommodate diverse rewards with only around 10% GPU hours compared with multi-objective RL baseline."}
{"title": "DPZero: Private Fine-Tuning of Language Models without Backpropagation", "abstract": "The widespread practice of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific data faces two major challenges in memory and privacy. First, as the size of LLMs continues to grow, the memory demands of gradient-based training methods via backpropagation become prohibitively high. Second, given the tendency of LLMs to memorize training data, it is important to protect potentially sensitive information in the fine-tuning data from being regurgitated. Zeroth-order methods, which rely solely on forward passes, substantially reduce memory consumption during training. However, directly combining them with standard differentially private gradient descent suffers more as model size grows. To bridge this gap, we introduce DPZero, a novel private zeroth-order algorithm with nearly dimension-independent rates. The memory efficiency of DPZero is demonstrated in privately fine-tuning RoBERTa and OPT on several downstream tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Liang137/DPZero."}

However, the emergence of biases and the potential for generating harmful content in LLMs, particularly under malicious inputs, pose significant challenges. Current mitigation strategies, while effective, are not resilient under adversarial attacks. This paper introduces Resilient Guardrails for Large Language Models (RigorLLM), a novel framework designed to efficiently and effectively moderate harmful and unsafe inputs and outputs for LLMs. By employing a multi-faceted approach that includes energy-based training data augmentation through Langevin dynamics, optimizing a safe suffix for inputs via minimax optimization, and integrating a fusion-based model combining robust KNN with LLMs based on our data augmentation, RigorLLM offers a robust solution to harmful content moderation. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that RigorLLM not only outperforms existing baselines like OpenAI API and Perspective API in detecting harmful content but also exhibits unparalleled resilience to jailbreaking attacks. The innovative use of constrained optimization and a fusion-based guardrail approach represents a significant step forward in developing more secure and reliable LLMs, setting a new standard for content moderation frameworks in the face of evolving digital threats."}

This novel approach offers a toolkit for phenotyping LLMs’ behavior. We apply *CogBench* to 40 LLMs, yielding a rich and diverse dataset. We analyze this data using statistical multilevel modeling techniques, accounting for the nested dependencies among fine-tuned versions of specific LLMs. Our study highlights the crucial role of model size and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in improving performance and aligning with human behavior. Interestingly, we find that open-source models are less risk-prone than proprietary models and that fine-tuning on code does not necessarily enhance LLMs' behavior. Finally, we explore the effects of prompt-engineering techniques. We discover that chain-of-thought prompting improves probabilistic reasoning, while take-a-step-back prompting fosters model-based behaviors."}

Specifically, these tasks require an understanding of the context in which the text interacts with visual elements within an image. However, there is a lack of existing datasets to benchmark the state-of-the-art multimodal models' capability on context-sensitive text-rich visual reasoning.

Further, we perform human evaluations of the model responses and observe a significant performance gap of 30.8% between GPT-4V (the current best-performing Large Multimodal Model) and human performance. Our fine-grained analysis reveals that GPT-4V encounters difficulties interpreting time-related data and infographics.

{"title": "A Sober Look at LLMs for Material Discovery: Are They Actually Good for Bayesian Optimization Over Molecules?", "abstract": "Automation is one of the cornerstones of contemporary material discovery. Bayesian optimization (BO) is an essential part of such workflows, enabling scientists to leverage prior domain knowledge into efficient exploration of a large molecular space. While such prior knowledge can take many forms, there has been significant fanfare around the ancillary scientific knowledge encapsulated in large language models (LLMs). However, existing work thus far has only explored LLMs for heuristic materials searches. Indeed, recent work obtains the uncertainty estimate---an integral part of BO---from point-estimated, _non-Bayesian_ LLMs. In this work, we study the question of whether LLMs are actually useful to accelerate principled _Bayesian_ optimization in the molecular space. We take a sober, dispassionate stance in answering this question. This is done by carefully (i) viewing LLMs as fixed feature extractors for standard but principled BO surrogate models and by (ii) leveraging parameter-efficient finetuning methods and Bayesian neural networks to obtain the posterior of the LLM surrogate. Our extensive experiments with real-world chemistry problems show that LLMs can be useful for BO over molecules, but only if they have been pretrained or finetuned with domain-specific data."}
{"title": "Think Before You Act: Decision Transformers with Working Memory", "abstract": "Decision Transformer-based decision-making agents have shown the ability to generalize across multiple tasks. However, their performance relies on massive data and computation. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the forgetting phenomenon, in which a model memorizes its behaviors in parameters throughout training. As a result, training on a new task may deteriorate the model's performance on previous tasks. In contrast to LLMs' implicit memory mechanism, the human brain utilizes distributed memory storage, which helps manage and organize multiple skills efficiently, mitigating the forgetting phenomenon. Inspired by this, we propose a working memory module to store, blend, and retrieve information for different downstream tasks. Evaluation results show that the proposed method improves training efficiency and generalization in Atari games and Meta-World object manipulation tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that memory fine-tuning further enhances the adaptability of the proposed architecture."}
{"title": "Prompt-based Visual Alignment for Zero-shot Policy Transfer", "abstract": "Overfitting in RL has become one of the main obstacles to applications in reinforcement learning(RL). Existing methods do not provide explicit semantic constrain for the feature extractor, hindering the agent from learning a unified cross-domain representation and resulting in performance degradation on unseen domains. Besides, abundant data from multiple domains are needed. To address these issues, in this work, we propose prompt-based visual alignment (PVA), a robust framework to mitigate the detrimental domain bias in the image for zero-shot policy transfer. Inspired that Visual-Language Model (VLM) can serve as a bridge to connect both text space and image space, we leverage the semantic information contained in a text sequence as an explicit constraint to train a visual aligner. Thus, the visual aligner can map images from multiple domains to a unified domain and achieve good generalization performance. To better depict semantic information, prompt tuning is applied to learn a sequence of learnable tokens. With explicit constraints of semantic information, PVA can learn unified cross-domain representation under limited access to cross-domain data and achieves great zero-shot generalization ability in unseen domains. We verify PVA on a vision-based autonomous driving task with CARLA simulator. Experiments show that the agent generalizes well on unseen domains under limited access to multi-domain data."}
{"title": "InstructRetro: Instruction Tuning post Retrieval-Augmented Pretraining", "abstract": "Pretraining auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) with retrieval demonstrates better perplexity and factual accuracy by leveraging external databases. However, the size of existing pretrained retrieval-augmented LLM is still limited (e.g., Retro has 7.5B parameters), which limits the effectiveness of instruction tuning and zero-shot generalization. In this work, we introduce Retro 48B, the largest LLM pretrained with retrieval. Specifically, we continue to pretrain a 43B GPT model on additional 100 billion tokens using the Retro augmentation method by retrieving from 1.2 trillion tokens. Notably, the obtained foundation model, Retro 48B, largely outperforms the counterpart GPT 43B trained on 1.2T tokens in terms of perplexity with only 2.58% additional GPU hours, demonstrating the significant scaling potential of the method. After instruction tuning on Retro, InstructRetro demonstrates significant improvement over the instruction-tuned GPT on a wide range of zero-shot tasks. Specifically, the average improvement of InstructRetro is 7% over its GPT counterpart across 8 short-form QA and reading comprehension tasks, 10% over GPT across 4 challenging long-form QA tasks, and 16% over GPT across 3 summarization tasks. Surprisingly, we find that one can ablate the encoder from InstructRetro architecture and directly use its decoder backbone, while achieving comparable results. Our results highlight the promising direction to obtain a better GPT decoder through continued pretraining with retrieval before instruction tuning. Our code and checkpoints are publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/retro-48b-instruct-4k."}
{"title": "Q-Align: Teaching LMMs for Visual Scoring via Discrete Text-Defined Levels", "abstract": "The explosion of visual content available online underscores the requirement for an accurate machine assessor to robustly evaluate scores across diverse types of visual contents. While recent studies have demonstrated the exceptional potentials of large multi-modality models (LMMs) on a wide range of related fields, in this work, we explore how to teach them for visual rating aligning with human opinions. Observing that human raters only learn and judge discrete text-defined levels in subjective studies, we propose to emulate this subjective process and teach LMMs with text-defined rating levels instead of scores. The proposed Q-Align achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on image quality assessment (IQA), image aesthetic assessment (IAA), as well as video quality assessment (VQA) under the original LMM structure. With the syllabus, we further unify the three tasks into one model, termed the OneAlign. Our experiments demonstrate the advantage of discrete levels over direct scores on training, and that LMMs can learn beyond the discrete levels and provide effective finer-grained evaluations. Code and weights will be released."}
{"title": "LESS: Selecting Influential Data for Targeted Instruction Tuning", "abstract": "Instruction tuning has unlocked powerful capabilities in large language models (LLMs), using combined datasets to develop general-purpose chatbots. However, real-world applications often require a specialized suite of skills (e.g., reasoning). The challenge lies in identifying the most relevant data from these extensive datasets to effectively develop specific capabilities, a setting we frame as *targeted instruction tuning*. We propose LESS, an optimizer-aware and practically efficient algorithm to estimate data influences and perform **L**ow-rank gradi**E**nt **S**imilarity **S**earch for instruction data selection. Crucially, LESS adapts existing influence formulations to work with the Adam optimizer and variable-length instruction data. LESS first constructs a highly reusable and transferable *gradient datastore* with low-dimensional gradient features and then selects examples based on their similarity to few-shot examples embodying a specific capability. Experiments show that training on a LESS-selected 5% of the data can often outperform training on the full dataset across diverse downstream tasks. Furthermore, the selected data is highly transferable: smaller models can be leveraged to select useful data for larger models and models from different families. Our qualitative analysis shows that our method goes beyond surface form cues to identify data that exemplifies the necessary reasoning skills for the intended downstream application. To facilitate future work, we release code and data at [princeton-nlp/LESS](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/LESS)."}
{"title": "Medusa: Simple LLM Inference Acceleration Framework with Multiple Decoding Heads", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) employ auto-regressive decoding that requires sequential computation, with each step reliant on the previous one's output. This creates a bottleneck as each step necessitates moving the full model parameters from High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to the accelerator's cache. While methods such as speculative decoding have been suggested to address this issue, their implementation is impeded by the challenges associated with acquiring and maintaining a separate draft model. In this paper, we present Medusa, an efficient method that augments LLM inference by adding extra decoding heads to predict multiple subsequent tokens in parallel. Using a tree-based attention mechanism, Medusa constructs multiple candidate continuations and verifies them simultaneously in each decoding step. By leveraging parallel processing, Medusa reduces the number of decoding steps required. We present two levels of fine-tuning procedures for Medusa to meet the needs of different use cases: Medusa-1: Medusa is directly fine-tuned on top of a frozen backbone LLM, enabling lossless inference acceleration. Medusa-2: Medusa is fine-tuned together with the backbone LLM, enabling better prediction accuracy of Medusa heads and higher speedup but needing a special training recipe that preserves the model's capabilities. Moreover, we propose several extensions that improve or expand the utility of Medusa, including a self-distillation to handle situations where no training data is available and a typical acceptance scheme to boost the acceptance rate while maintaining generation quality. We evaluate Medusa on models of various sizes and training procedures. Our experiments demonstrate that Medusa-1 can achieve over 2.2$\\times$ speedup without compromising generation quality, while Medusa-2 further improves the speedup to 2.3-2.8$\\times$."}
{"title": "In-Context Principle Learning from Mistakes", "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL, also known as few-shot prompting) has been the standard method of adapting LLMs to downstream tasks, by learning from a few input-output examples. Nonetheless, all ICL-based approaches only learn from correct input-output pairs. In this paper, we revisit this paradigm, by learning more from the few given input-output examples. We introduce Learning Principles (LEAP): First, we intentionally induce the model to make mistakes on these few examples; then we reflect on these mistakes, and learn explicit task-specific “principles” from them, which help solve similar problems and avoid common mistakes; finally, we prompt the model to answer unseen test questions using the original few-shot examples and these learned general principles. We evaluate LEAP on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-hop question answering (Hotpot QA), textual QA (DROP), Big-Bench Hard reasoning, and math problems (GSM8K and MATH); in all these benchmarks, LEAP improves the strongest available LLMs such as GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo and Claude-2.1. For example, LEAP improves over the standard few-shot prompting using GPT-4 by 7.5% in DROP, and by 3.3% in HotpotQA. Importantly, LEAP does not require any more input or examples than the standard few-shot prompting settings."}
{"title": "Verification of Machine Unlearning is Fragile", "abstract": "As privacy concerns escalate in the realm of machine learning, data owners now have the option to utilize machine unlearning to remove their data from machine learning models, following recent legislation. To enhance transparency in machine unlearning and avoid potential dishonesty by model providers, various verification strategies have been proposed. These strategies enable data owners to ascertain whether their target data has been effectively unlearned from the model. However, our understanding of the safety issues of machine unlearning verification remains nascent. In this paper, we explore the novel research question of whether model providers can circumvent verification strategies while retaining the information of data supposedly unlearned. Our investigation leads to a pessimistic answer: the verification of machine unlearning is fragile. Specifically, we categorize the current verification strategies regarding potential dishonesty among model providers into two types. Subsequently, we introduce two novel adversarial unlearning processes capable of circumventing both types. We validate the efficacy of our methods through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments using real-world datasets. This study highlights the vulnerabilities and limitations in machine unlearning verification, paving the way for further research into the safety of machine unlearning."}
{"title": "Controllable Prompt Tuning For Balancing Group Distributional Robustness", "abstract": "Models trained on data composed of different groups or domains can suffer from severe performance degradation under distribution shifts. While recent methods have largely focused on optimizing the worst-group objective, this often comes at the expense of good performance on other groups. To address this problem, we introduce an optimization scheme to achieve good performance across groups and find a good solution for all without severely sacrificing performance on any of them. However, directly applying such optimization involves updating the parameters of the entire network, making it both computationally expensive and challenging. Thus, we introduce Controllable Prompt Tuning (CPT), which couples our approach with prompt-tuning techniques. On spurious correlation benchmarks, our procedures achieve state-of-the-art results across both transformer and non-transformer architectures, as well as unimodal and multimodal data, while requiring only $0.4\\%$ tunable parameters."}
{"title": "A Human-Inspired Reading Agent with Gist Memory of Very Long Contexts", "abstract": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are not only limited to some maximum context length, but also are not able to robustly consume long inputs. To address these limitations, we propose ReadAgent, an LLM agent system that increases effective context length up to 20x in our experiments. Inspired by how humans interactively read long documents, we implement ReadAgent as a simple prompting system that uses the advanced language capabilities of LLMs to (1) decide what content to store together in a memory episode, (2) compress those memory episodes into short episodic memories called *gist memories*, and (3) take actions to look up passages in the original text if ReadAgent needs to remind itself of relevant details to complete a task. We evaluate ReadAgent against baselines using retrieval methods, using the original long contexts, and using the gist memories. These evaluations are performed on three long-document reading comprehension tasks: QuALITY, NarrativeQA, and QMSum. ReadAgent outperforms the baselines on all three tasks while extending the effective context window by 3.5-20x."}
{"title": "LongRoPE: Extending LLM Context Window Beyond 2 Million Tokens", "abstract": "Large context window is a desirable feature in large language models (LLMs). However, due to high fine-tuning costs, scarcity of long texts, and catastrophic values introduced by new token positions, current extended context windows are limited to around 128k tokens. This paper introduces LongRoPE that, for the first time, extends the context window of pre-trained LLMs to an impressive 2048k tokens, with up to only 1k fine-tuning steps at within 256k training lengths, while maintaining performance at the original short context window. This is achieved by three key innovations: (i) we identify and exploit two forms of non-uniformities in positional interpolation through an efficient search, providing a better initialization for fine-tuning and enabling an 8x extension in non-fine-tuning scenarios; (ii) we introduce a progressive extension strategy that first fine-tunes a 256k length LLM and then conducts a second positional interpolation on the fine-tuned extended LLM to achieve a 2048k context window; (iii) we readjust LongRoPE on 8k length to recover the short context window performance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA2 and Mistral across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Models extended via LongRoPE retain the original architecture with minor modifications to the positional embedding, and can reuse most pre-existing optimizations.

We introduce a group-theoretic framework that defines code symmetries as semantics-preserving transformations, where forming a code symmetry group enables precise and efficient reasoning of code semantics. Our solution, SymC, develops a novel variant of self-attention that is provably equivariant to code symmetries from the permutation group defined over the program dependence graph. SymC obtains superior performance on five program analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art code models, including GPT-4, without any pre-training. Our results suggest that code LLMs that encode the code structural prior via the code symmetry group generalize better and faster."}
{"title": "KV-Runahead: Scalable Causal LLM Inference by Parallel Key-Value Cache Generation", "abstract": "Large Language Model or LLM inference has two phases, the prompt (or prefill) phase to output the first token and the extension (or decoding) phase to the generate subsequent tokens. In this work, we propose an efficient parallelization scheme, KV-Runahead to accelerate the prompt phase. The key observation is that the extension phase generates tokens faster than the prompt phase because of key-value cache (KV-cache). Hence, KV-Runahead parallelizes the prompt phase by orchestrating multiple processes to populate the KV-cache and minimizes the time-to-first-token (TTFT). Dual-purposing the KV-cache scheme has two main benefits. First, since KV-cache is designed to leverage the causal attention map, we minimize computation and computation automatically. Second, since it already exists for the extension phase, KV-Runahead is easy to implement. We further propose context-level load-balancing to handle uneven KV-cache generation (due to the causal attention) and to optimize TTFT. Compared with an existing parallelization scheme such as tensor or sequential parallelization where keys and values are locally generated and exchanged via all-gather collectives, our experimental results demonstrate that KV-Runahead can offer over 1.4× and 1.6× speedups for Llama 7B and Falcon 7B respectively."}
{"title": "What needs to go right for an induction head? A mechanistic study of in-context learning circuits and their formation", "abstract": "In-context learning is a powerful emergent ability in transformer models. Prior work in mechanistic interpretability has identified a circuit element that may be critical for in-context learning – the induction head (IH), which performs a match-and-copy operation. During training of large transformers on natural language data, IHs emerge around the same time as a notable phase change in the loss. Despite the robust evidence for IHs and this interesting coincidence with the phase change, relatively little is known about the diversity and emergence dynamics of IHs. Why is there more than one IH, and how are they dependent on each other? Why do IHs appear all of a sudden, and what are the subcircuits that enable them to emerge? We answer these questions by studying IH emergence dynamics in a controlled setting by training on synthetic data. In doing so, we develop and share a novel optogenetics-inspired causal framework for modifying activations throughout training. Using this framework, we delineate the diverse and additive nature of IHs. By \"clamping\" subsets of activations throughout training, we then identify three underlying subcircuits that interact to drive IH formation, yielding the phase change. Furthermore, these subcircuits shed light on data-dependent properties of formation, such as phase change timing, already showing the promise of this more in-depth understanding of subcircuits that need to \"go right\" for an induction head."}
{"title": "Self-Play Fine-Tuning Converts Weak Language Models to Strong Language Models", "abstract": "Harnessing the power of human-annotated data through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is pivotal for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we delve into the prospect of growing a strong LLM out of a weak one without the need for acquiring additional human-annotated data. We propose a new fine-tuning method called Self-Play fIne-tuNing (SPIN), which starts from a supervised fine-tuned model. At the heart of SPIN lies a self-play mechanism, where the LLM refines its capability by playing against instances of itself. More specifically, the LLM generates its own training data from its previous iterations, refining its policy by discerning these self-generated responses from those obtained from human-annotated data. Our method progressively elevates the LLM from a nascent model to a formidable one, unlocking the full potential of human-annotated demonstration data for SFT. Theoretically, we prove that the global optimum to the training objective function of our method is achieved only when the LLM policy aligns with the target data distribution. Empirically, we evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets including the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard, MT-Bench, and datasets from Big-Bench. Our results show that SPIN can significantly improve the LLM's performance across a variety of benchmarks and even outperform models trained through direct preference optimization (DPO) supplemented with extra GPT-4 preference data. This sheds light on the promise of self-play, enabling the achievement of human-level performance in LLMs without the need for expert opponents."}
{"title": "LIDAO: Towards Limited Interventions for Debiasing (Large) Language Models", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on various natural language generation tasks. Nonetheless, they suffer from generating negative and harmful contents that are biased against certain demographic groups (e.g., female), raising severe fairness concerns. As remedies, prior works intervened the generation by removing attitude or demographic information, inevitably degrading the generation quality and resulting in notable *fairness-fluency* trade-offs. However, it is still under-explored to what extent the fluency *has to* be affected in order to achieve a desired level of fairness. In this work, we conduct the first formal study from an information-theoretic perspective. We show that previous approaches are excessive for debiasing and propose LIDAO, a general framework to debias a (L)LM at a better fluency provably. We further robustify LIDAO in adversarial scenarios, where a carefully-crafted prompt may stimulate LLMs exhibiting instruction-following abilities to generate texts with fairness issue appears only when the prompt is also taken into account. Experiments on three LMs ranging from 0.7B to 7B parameters demonstrate the superiority of our method."}
{"title": "Improving Context Understanding in Multimodal Large Language Models via Multimodal Composition Learning", "abstract": "Previous efforts using frozen Large Language Models (LLMs) for visual understanding, via image captioning or image-text retrieval tasks, face challenges when dealing with complex multimodal scenarios. In order to enhance the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) in comprehending the context of vision and language, we introduce Multimodal Composition Learning (MCL) for the purpose of mapping or aligning the vision and language input. In particular, we introduce two tasks: Multimodal-Context Captioning (MC-Cap) and Multimodal-Context Retrieval (MC-Ret) to guide a frozen LLM in comprehending the vision and language context. These specialized tasks are crafted to improve the LLM’s capacity for efficient processing and utilization of multimodal inputs, thereby enhancing its proficiency in generating more accurate text or visual representations. Extensive experiments on both retrieval tasks (i.e., zero-shot composed image retrieval, visual storytelling image retrieval and visual dialog image retrieval) and text generation tasks (i.e., visual question answering) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

As we humans always perceive the world and communicate with people through various modalities, developing any-to-any MM-LLMs capable of accepting and delivering content in any modality becomes essential to human-level AI. To fill the gap, we present an end-to-end general-purpose any-to-any MM-LLM system, NExT-GPT. We connect an LLM with multimodal adaptors and different diffusion decoders, enabling NExT-GPT to perceive inputs and generate outputs in arbitrary combinations of text, image, video, and audio. By leveraging the existing well-trained high-performing encoders and decoders, NExT-GPT is tuned with only a small amount of parameter (1%) of certain projection layers, which not only benefits low-cost training but also facilitates convenient expansion to more potential modalities. Moreover, we introduce a modality-switching instruction tuning (MosIT) and manually curate a high-quality dataset for MosIT, based on which NExT-GPT is empowered with complex cross-modal semantic understanding and content generation. Overall, our research showcases the promising possibility of building a unified AI agent capable of modeling universal modalities, paving the way for more human-like AI research in the community."}

LoCoCo employs only a fixed-size Key-Value (KV) cache, and can enhance efficiency in both inference and fine-tuning stages. Diverging from prior methods that selectively drop KV pairs based on heuristics, LoCoCo leverages a data-driven adaptive fusion technique, blending previous KV pairs with incoming tokens to minimize the loss of contextual information and ensure accurate attention modeling. This token integration is achieved through injecting one-dimensional convolutional kernels that dynamically calculate mixing weights for each KV cache slot. Designed for broad compatibility with existing LLM frameworks, LoCoCo allows for straightforward \"drop-in\" integration without needing architectural modifications, while incurring minimal tuning overhead. Experiments demonstrate that LoCoCo maintains consistently outstanding performance across various context lengths and can achieve a high context compression rate during both inference and fine-tuning phases. During inference, we successfully compressed up to $3482$ tokens into a $128$-size KV cache, while retaining comparable performance to the full sequence - an accuracy improvement of up to $0.2791$ compared to baselines at the same cache size. During post-training tuning, we also effectively extended the context length from 4K to 32K using a KV cache of fixed size 512, achieving performance similar to fine-tuning with entire sequences."}
{"title": "LoRA+: Efficient Low Rank Adaptation of Large Models", "abstract": "In this paper, we show that Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as originally introduced in (Hu et al., 2021) leads to suboptimal finetuning of models with large width. This is due to the fact that adapter matrices A and B in LoRA are updated with the same learning rate in ADAM. Using scaling arguments for large width networks, we demonstrate that the same learning rate does not allow efficient feature learning. We then show that this suboptimality of LoRA can be corrected simply by setting different learning rates for the LoRA adapter matrices A and B with a well-chosen fixed ratio. We call this proposed algorithm LoRA+. In our extensive experiments, LoRA+ improves finetuning speed (up to ∼ 2X SpeedUp) and performance (1% − 2% improvements), at the same computational cost as LoRA.

{"title": "Risk Aware Benchmarking of Large Language Models", "abstract": "We propose a distributional framework for benchmarking socio-technical risks of foundation models with quantified statistical significance. Our approach hinges on a new statistical relative testing based on first and second order stochastic dominance of real random variables. We show that the second order statistics in this test are linked to mean-risk models commonly used in econometrics and mathematical finance to balance risk and utility when choosing between alternatives. Using this framework, we formally develop a risk-aware approach for foundation model selection given guardrails quantified by specified metrics. Inspired by portfolio optimization and selection theory in mathematical finance, we define a metrics portfolio for each model as a means to aggregate a collection of metrics, and perform model selection based on the stochastic dominance of these portfolios. The statistical significance of our tests is backed theoretically by an asymptotic analysis via central limit theorems instantiated in practice via a bootstrap variance estimate. We use our framework to compare various large language models regarding risks related to drifting from instructions and outputting toxic content."}

Their performance can be further enhanced through few-shot prompt tuning methods. However, current studies evaluate the performance of learned prompts separately on base and new classes. This evaluation lacks practicality for real-world applications since downstream tasks cannot determine whether the data belongs to base or new classes in advance. In this paper, we explore a problem setting called ***O**pen-world **P**rompt **T**uning* (OPT), which involves tuning prompts on base classes and evaluating on a combination of base and new classes. By introducing ***De**composed **P**rompt **T**uning* framework (DePT), we theoretically demonstrate that OPT can be solved by incorporating out-of-distribution detection into prompt tuning, thereby enhancing the base-to-new discriminability.

{"title": "Instruction Tuning for Secure Code Generation", "abstract": "Modern language models (LMs) have gained widespread acceptance in everyday and professional contexts, particularly in programming. An essential procedure enabling this adoption is instruction tuning, which substantially enhances LMs' practical utility by training them to follow user instructions and human preferences. However, existing instruction tuning schemes overlook a crucial aspect: the security of generated code. As a result, even the state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LMs frequently produce unsafe code, posing significant security risks. In this work, we introduce SafeCoder to address this gap. SafeCoder performs security-centric fine-tuning using a diverse and high-quality dataset that we collected using an automated pipeline. We integrate the security fine-tuning with standard instruction tuning, to facilitate a joint optimization of both security and utility. Despite its simplicity, we show that SafeCoder is effective across a variety of popular LMs and datasets. It is able to drastically improve security (by about 30%), while preserving utility."}
{"title": "Unifying Image Processing as Visual Prompting Question Answering", "abstract": "Image processing is a fundamental task in computer vision, which aims at enhancing image quality and extracting essential features for subsequent vision applications. Traditionally, task-specific models are developed for individual tasks and designing such models requires distinct expertise. Building upon the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP), there is a similar trend in computer vision, which focuses on developing large-scale models through pretraining and in-context learning. This paradigm shift reduces the reliance on task-specific models, yielding a powerful unified model to deal with various tasks. However, these advances have predominantly concentrated on high-level vision tasks, with less attention paid to low-level vision tasks. To address this issue, we propose a universal model for general image processing that covers image restoration, image enhancement, image feature extraction tasks, etc. Our proposed framework, named PromptGIP, unifies these diverse image processing tasks within a universal framework. Inspired by NLP question answering (QA) techniques, we employ a visual prompting question answering paradigm. Specifically, we treat the input-output image pair as a structured question-answer sentence, thereby reprogramming the image processing task as a prompting QA problem. PromptGIP can undertake diverse cross-domain tasks using provided visual prompts, eliminating the need for task-specific finetuning. Capable of handling up to 15 different image processing tasks, PromptGIP represents a versatile and adaptive approach to general image processing. While PromptGIP has demonstrated a certain degree of out-of-domain task generalization capability, further research is expected to fully explore its more powerful emergent generalization.

{"title": "Reason for Future, Act for Now: A Principled Architecture for Autonomous LLM Agents", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning abilities, but translating reasoning into actions in the real world remains challenging. In particular, it is unclear how to complete a given task provably within a minimum number of interactions with the external environment, e.g., through an internal mechanism of reasoning. To this end, we propose the first framework with provable regret guarantees to orchestrate reasoning and acting, which we call *reason for future, act for now* (**RAFA**). Specifically, we design a prompt template for reasoning that learns from the memory buffer and plans a future trajectory over a long horizon (*reason for future*). At each step, the LLM agent takes the initial action of the planned trajectory (*act for now*), stores the collected feedback in the memory buffer, and reinvokes the reasoning routine to replan the future trajectory from the new state. The key idea is to cast reasoning in LLMs as learning and planning in Bayesian adaptive Markov decision processes (MDPs). Correspondingly, we prompt LLMs with the memory buffer to estimate the unknown environment (learning) and generate an optimal trajectory for multiple future steps that maximize a value function (planning). The learning and planning subroutines are performed in an in-context manner to emulate the actor-critic update for MDPs. Our theoretical analysis establishes a $\\sqrt{T}$ regret, while our experimental validation demonstrates superior empirical performance."}

We present DeDer, a framework for decomposing and distilling the embodied reasoning capabilities from LLMs to efficient, small language model (sLM)-based policies. In DeDer, the decision-making process of LLM-based strategies is restructured into a hierarchy with a reasoning-policy and planning-policy. The reasoning-policy is distilled from the data that is generated through the embodied in-context learning and self-verification of an LLM, so it can produce effective rationales. The planning-policy, guided by the rationales, can render optimized plans efficiently. In turn, DeDer allows for adopting sLMs for both policies, deployed on off-the-shelf devices. Furthermore, to enhance the quality of intermediate rationales, specific to embodied tasks, we devise the embodied knowledge graph, and to generate multiple rationales timely through a single inference, we also use the contrastively prompted attention model. Our experiments with the ALFRED benchmark demonstrate that DeDer surpasses leading language planning and distillation approaches, indicating the applicability and efficiency of sLM-based embodied policies derived through DeDer."}

In particular, we find that the robustness of SMoE is sensitive to the basic training settings. We hope that this study can provide deeper insights into how to adapt the pre-trained MoE model to other tasks with higher-generation security, quality, and stability.

Traditional LLMs face challenges in generating regulated and compliant responses in special scenarios with predetermined response guidelines, like emotional support and customer service. Our framework addresses these challenges by embedding a Definite Finite Automaton (DFA), learned from training dialogues, within the LLM. This structured approach acts as a semantic router which enables the LLM to adhere to a deterministic response pathway. The routing is achieved by the retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) strategy, which carefully selects dialogue examples aligned with the current conversational context. The advantages of DFA-RAG include an interpretable structure through human-readable DFA, context-aware retrieval for responses in conversations, and plug-and-play compatibility with existing LLMs. Extensive benchmarks validate DFA-RAG's effectiveness, indicating its potential as a valuable contribution to the conversational agent."}
{"title": "Tag-LLM: Repurposing General-Purpose LLMs for Specialized Domains", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating natural language. However, their capabilities wane in highly specialized domains underrepresented in the pretraining corpus, such as physical and biomedical sciences. This work explores how to repurpose general LLMs into effective task solvers for specialized domains. We introduce a novel, model-agnostic framework for learning custom input tags, which are parameterized as continuous vectors appended to the LLM’s embedding layer, to condition the LLM. We design two types of input tags: domain tags are used to delimit specialized representations (e.g., chemical formulas) and provide domain-relevant context; function tags are used to represent specific functions (e.g., predicting molecular properties) and compress function-solving instructions. We develop a three-stage protocol to learn these tags using auxiliary data and domain knowledge. By explicitly disentangling task domains from task functions, our method enables zero-shot generalization to unseen problems through diverse combinations of the input tags. It also boosts LLM’s performance in various specialized domains, such as predicting protein or chemical properties and modeling drug-target interactions, outperforming expert models tailored to these tasks."}

Despite their widespread success, existing LLM agents are hindered by generating unreasonable experiment plans within this scenario. To this end, we present DS-Agent, a novel automatic framework that harnesses LLM agent and case-based reasoning (CBR). In the development stage, DS-Agent follows the CBR framework to structure an automatic iteration pipeline, which can flexibly capitalize on the expert knowledge from Kaggle, and facilitate consistent performance improvement through the feedback mechanism. Moreover, DS-Agent implements a low-resource deployment stage with a simplified CBR paradigm to adapt past successful solutions from the development stage for direct code generation, significantly reducing the demand on foundational capabilities of LLMs. Empirically, DS-Agent with GPT-4 achieves 100% success rate in the development stage, while attaining 36% improvement on average one pass rate across alternative LLMs in the deployment stage. In both stages, DS-Agent achieves the best rank in performance, costing \r\n$1.60 and \\\\$0.13 per run with GPT-4, respectively.

{"title": "Differentially Private Synthetic Data via Foundation Model APIs 2: Text", "abstract": "Text data has become extremely valuable due to the emergence of machine learning algorithms that learn from it. A lot of high-quality text data generated in the real world is private and therefore cannot be shared or used freely due to privacy concerns. Generating synthetic replicas of private text data with a formal privacy guarantee, i.e., differential privacy (DP), offers a promising and scalable solution. However, existing methods necessitate DP finetuning of large language models (LLMs) on private data to generate DP synthetic data. This approach is not viable for proprietary LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5) and also demands considerable computational resources for open-source LLMs. Lin et al. (2024) recently introduced the Private Evolution (PE) algorithm to generate DP synthetic images with only API access to diffusion models. In this work, we propose an augmented PE algorithm, named Aug-PE, that applies to the complex setting of text. We use API access to an LLM and generate DP synthetic text without any model training. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that Aug-PE produces DP synthetic text that yields competitive utility with the SOTA DP finetuning baselines. This underscores the feasibility of relying solely on API access of LLMs to produce high-quality DP synthetic texts, thereby facilitating more accessible routes to privacy-preserving LLM applications."}

We propose DE-COP, a method to determine whether a piece of copyrighted content is included in training. DE-COP's core approach is to probe an LLM with multiple-choice questions, whose options include both verbatim text and their paraphrases. We construct BookTection, a benchmark with excerpts from 165 books published prior and subsequent to a model's training cutoff, along with their paraphrases. Our experiments show that DE-COP outperforms the prior best method by 8.6% in detection accuracy (AUC) on models with logits available. Moreover, DE-COP also achieves an average accuracy of 72% for detecting suspect books on fully black-box models where prior methods give approximately 0% accuracy.

{"title": "Successor Features for Efficient Multi-Subject Controlled Text Generation", "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in generating fluent and realistic text, controlling the generated text so that it exhibits properties such as safety, factuality, and non-toxicity remains challenging. Existing decoding-based controllable text generation methods are static in terms of the dimension of control; if the target subject is changed, they require new training. Moreover, it can quickly become prohibitive to concurrently control multiple subjects. To address these challenges, we first show that existing methods can be framed as a reinforcement learning problem, where an action-value function estimates the likelihood of a desired attribute appearing in the generated text. Then, we introduce a novel approach named SF-Gen, which leverages the concept of successor features to decouple the dynamics of LLMs from task-specific rewards. By employing successor features, our method proves to be memory-efficient and computationally efficient for both training and decoding, especially when dealing with multiple target subjects. To the best of our knowledge, our research represents the first application of successor features in text generation. In addition to its computational efficiency, the resultant language produced by our method is comparable to the SOTA (and outperforms baselines) in both control measures as well as language quality, which we demonstrate through a series of experiments in various controllable text generation tasks."}
{"title": "GLoRe: When, Where, and How to Improve LLM Reasoning via Global and Local Refinements", "abstract": "State-of-the-art language models can exhibit reasoning refinement capabilities on math, science or coding tasks. However, recent work demonstrates that even the best models struggle to identify *when and where to refine* without access to external feedback. In this paper, we propose Stepwise ORMs (**SORMs**) which are trained, only on synthetic data, to approximate the expected future reward of the optimal policy or $V^{\\star}$ as a form of Process-based reward modeling. Our experiments show that SORMs can more accurately detect incorrect reasoning steps compared to ORMs, thus enabling them to give precise step-level feedback to refinement models. We then train *global* refinement models, which take only the question and a draft solution as input and predict a corrected solution, and *local* refinement models which also take as input a critique indicating the location of the first reasoning error. We generate training data for both models synthetically by reusing data used to train the SORM. We find combining global and local refinements, using the ORM as a reranker, significantly outperforms either one individually, as well as a best of three sample baseline. With this strategy we can improve the accuracy of a LLaMA-2 13B model (already fine-tuned with RL) on GSM8K from 53% to 65% when greedily sampled."}
{"title": "Copyright Traps for Large Language Models", "abstract": "Questions of fair use of copyright-protected content to train Large Language Models (LLMs) are being actively debated. Document-level inference has been proposed as a new task: inferring from black-box access to the trained model whether a piece of content has been seen during training. SOTA methods however rely on naturally occurring memorization of (part of) the content. While very effective against models that memorize significantly, we hypothesize - and later confirm - that they will not work against models that do not naturally memorize, e.g. medium-size 1B models. We here propose to use copyright traps, the inclusion of fictitious entries in original content, to detect the use of copyrighted materials in LLMs with a focus on models where memorization does not naturally occur. We carefully design a randomized controlled experimental setup, inserting traps into original content (books) and train a 1.3B LLM from scratch. We first validate that the use of content in our target model would be undetectable using existing methods. We then show, contrary to intuition, that even medium-length trap sentences repeated a significant number of times (100) are not detectable using existing methods. However, we show that longer sequences repeated a large number of times can be reliably detected (AUC=0.75) and used as copyright traps. Beyond copyright applications, our findings contribute to the study of LLM memorization: the randomized controlled setup enables us to draw causal relationships between memorization and certain sequence properties such as repetition in model training data and perplexity."}
{"title": "CaM: Cache Merging for Memory-efficient LLMs Inference", "abstract": "Despite the exceptional performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), the substantial volume of key-value (KV) pairs cached during inference presents a barrier to their efficient deployment. To ameliorate this, recent works have aimed to selectively eliminate these caches, informed by the attention scores of associated tokens. However, such cache eviction invariably leads to output perturbation, regardless of the token choice. This perturbation escalates with the compression ratio, which can precipitate a marked deterioration in LLM inference performance. This paper introduces Cache Merging (CaM) as a solution to mitigate this challenge. CaM adaptively merges to-be-evicted caches into the remaining ones, employing a novel sampling strategy governed by the prominence of attention scores within discarded locations. In this manner, CaM enables memory-efficient LLMs to preserve critical token information, even obviating the need to maintain their corresponding caches. Extensive experiments utilizing LLaMA, OPT, and GPT-NeoX across various benchmarks corroborate CaM's proficiency in bolstering the performance of memory-efficient LLMs. Code is released at https://github.com/zyxxmu/cam."}
{"title": "Language Generation with Strictly Proper Scoring Rules", "abstract": "Language generation based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) has become the fundamental approach for text generation. Maximum likelihood estimation is typically performed by minimizing the log-likelihood loss, also known as the logarithmic score in statistical decision theory. The logarithmic score is strictly proper in the sense that it encourages honest forecasts, where the expected score is maximized only when the model reports true probabilities. Although many strictly proper scoring rules exist, the logarithmic score is the only local scoring rule among them that depends exclusively on the probability of the observed sample, making it capable of handling the exponentially large sample space of natural text. In this work, we propose a straightforward strategy for adapting scoring rules to language generation, allowing for language modeling with any non-local scoring rules. Leveraging this strategy, we train language generation models using two classic strictly proper scoring rules, the Brier score and the Spherical score, as alternatives to the logarithmic score. Experimental results indicate that simply substituting the loss function, without adjusting other hyperparameters, can yield substantial improvements in model's generation capabilities. Moreover, these improvements can scale up to large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B. Source code: https://github.com/shaochenze/ScoringRulesLM."}
{"title": "KIVI: A Tuning-Free Asymmetric 2bit Quantization for KV Cache", "abstract": "Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) requires batching many requests together to reduce the cost per request. Yet, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores attention keys and values to avoid re-computations, significantly increases memory demands and becomes the new bottleneck in speed and memory usage. This memory demand increases with larger batch sizes and longer context lengths. Additionally, the inference speed is limited by the size of KV cache, as the GPU's SRAM must load the entire KV cache from the main GPU memory for each token generated, causing the computational core to be idle during this process. A straightforward and effective solution to reduce KV cache size is quantization, which decreases the total bytes taken by KV cache. However, there is a lack of in-depth studies that explore the element distribution of KV cache to understand the hardness and limitation of KV cache quantization. To fill the gap, we conducted a comprehensive study on the element distribution in KV cache of popular LLMs. Our findings indicate that the key cache should be quantized per-channel, i.e., group elements along the channel dimension and quantize them together. In contrast, the value cache should be quantized per-token. From this analysis, we developed a tuning-free 2bit KV cache quantization algorithm, named KIVI. With the hardware-friendly implementation, KIVI can enable Llama (Llama-2), Falcon, and Mistral models to maintain almost the same quality while using 2.6$\\times$ less peak memory usage (including the model weight). This reduction in memory usage enables up to 4x larger batch size, bringing $2.35 \\times \\sim 3.47 \\times$ throughput on real LLM inference workload."}
{"title": "QUEST: Query-Aware Sparsity for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference", "abstract": "As the demand for long-context large language models (LLMs) increases, models with context windows of up to 128K or 1M tokens are becoming increasingly prevalent. However, long-context LLM inference is challenging since the inference speed decreases significantly as the sequence length grows. This slowdown is primarily caused by loading a large KV cache during self-attention. Previous works have shown that a small portion of critical tokens will dominate the attention outcomes. However, we observe the criticality of a token highly depends on the query. To this end, we propose Quest, a query-aware KV cache selection algorithm. Quest keeps track of the minimal and maximal Key values in KV cache pages and estimates the criticality of a given page using Query vectors. By only loading the Top-K critical KV cache pages for attention, Quest significantly speeds up self-attention without sacrificing accuracy. We show that Quest can achieve up to 2.23x self-attention speedup, which reduces inference latency by 7.03x while performing well on tasks with long dependencies with negligible accuracy loss.

{"title": "AI Control: Improving Safety Despite Intentional Subversion", "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become more powerful and are deployed more autonomously, it will be increasingly important to prevent them from causing harmful outcomes. To do so, safety measures either aim at making LLMs try to avoid harmful outcomes or aim at preventing LLMs from causing harmful outcomes, even if they try to cause them. In this paper, we focus on this second layer of defense. We develop and evaluate pipelines of safety techniques (protocols) that try to ensure safety despite intentional subversion - an approach we call AI control. We investigate a setting in which we want to solve a sequence of programming problems without ever submitting subtly wrong code, using access to a powerful but untrusted model (in our case, GPT-4), access to a less powerful trusted model (in our case, GPT-3.5), and limited access to high-quality trusted labor. We investigate a range of protocols and red-team them by exploring strategies that the untrusted model could use to subvert them. We find that using the trusted model to edit untrusted-model code or using the untrusted model as a monitor substantially improves on simple baselines."}
{"title": "MathScale: Scaling Instruction Tuning for Mathematical Reasoning", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in problem-solving. However, their proficiency in solving mathematical problems remains inadequate. We propose MathScale, a simple and scalable method to create high-quality mathematical reasoning data using frontier LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5). Inspired by the cognitive mechanism in human mathematical learning, it first extracts topics and knowledge points from seed math questions and then build a concept graph, which is subsequently used to generate new math questions. MathScale exhibits effective scalability along the size axis of the math dataset that we generate. As a result, we create a mathematical reasoning dataset (MathScaleQA) containing two million math question-answer pairs. To evaluate mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs comprehensively, we construct MWPBench, a benchmark of Math Word Problems, which is a collection of 9 datasets (including GSM8K and MATH) covering K-12, college, and competition level math problems. We apply MathScaleQA to fine-tune open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2 and Mistral), resulting in significantly improved capabilities in mathematical reasoning. Evaluated on MWPBench, MathScale-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets, surpassing its best peers of equivalent size by 42.8% in micro average accuracy and 43.6% in macro average accuracy, respectively."}

Our extensive experiments explore the intricacies of iterative prompting variants, examining their influence on the accuracy and calibration of model responses. Our findings reveal that naive prompting methods significantly undermine truthfulness, leading to exacerbated calibration errors. In response to these challenges, we introduce several prompting variants designed to address the identified issues. These variants demonstrate marked improvements over existing baselines, signaling a promising direction for future research. Our work provides a nuanced understanding of iterative prompting and introduces novel approaches to enhance the truthfulness of LLMs, thereby contributing to the development of more accurate and trustworthy AI systems"}
{"title": "Fundamental Limitations of Alignment in Large Language Models", "abstract": "An important aspect in developing language models that interact with humans is aligning their behavior to be useful and unharmful for their human users. This is usually achieved by tuning the model in a way that enhances desired behaviors and inhibits undesired ones, a process referred to as alignment. In this paper, we propose a theoretical approach called Behavior Expectation Bounds (BEB) which allows us to formally investigate several inherent characteristics and limitations of alignment in large language models. Importantly, we prove that within the limits of this framework, for any behavior that has a finite probability of being exhibited by the model, there exist prompts that can trigger the model into outputting this behavior, with probability that increases with the length of the prompt. This implies that any alignment process that attenuates an undesired behavior but does not remove it altogether, is not safe against adversarial prompting attacks. Furthermore, our framework hints at the mechanism by which leading alignment approaches such as reinforcement learning from human feedback make the LLM prone to being prompted into the undesired behaviors. This theoretical result is being experimentally demonstrated in large scale by the so called contemporary \"chatGPT jailbreaks\", where adversarial users trick the LLM into breaking its alignment guardrails by triggering it into acting as a malicious persona. Our results expose fundamental limitations in alignment of LLMs and bring to the forefront the need to devise reliable mechanisms for ensuring AI safety."}

Yet, the widespread use of popular models means that the ecosystem of online data and text will co-evolve to progressively contain increased amounts of synthesized data. In this paper we ask: *How will the scaling laws change in the inevitable regime where synthetic data makes its way into the training corpus?* Will future models, still improve, or be doomed to degenerate up to total *(model) collapse*? We develop a theoretical framework of model collapse through the lens of scaling laws. We discover a wide range of decay phenomena, analyzing loss of scaling, shifted scaling with number of generations, the ''un-learning\" of skills, and grokking when mixing human and synthesized data. Our theory is validated by large-scale experiments with a transformer on an arithmetic task and text generation using the large language model Llama2."}

UPAM enables gradient-based optimization, offering greater effectiveness and efficiency than previous methods. Given that T2I models might not return results due to defense mechanisms, we introduce a Sphere-Probing Learning (SPL) scheme to support gradient optimization even when no results are returned. Additionally, we devise a Semantic-Enhancing Learning (SEL) scheme to finetune UPAM for generating target-aligned images. Our framework also ensures attack stealthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrate UPAM's effectiveness and efficiency."}

Recent LMMs have shown various intriguing abilities, such as solving math problems written on the blackboard, reasoning about events and celebrities in news images, and explaining visual jokes. Rapid model advancements pose challenges to evaluation benchmark development. Problems include: (1) How to systematically structure and evaluate the complicated multimodal tasks; (2) How to design evaluation metrics that work well across question and answer types; and (3) How to give model insights beyond a simple performance ranking. To this end, we present MM-Vet, designed based on the insight that the intriguing ability to solve complicated tasks is often achieved by a generalist model being able to integrate different core vision-language (VL) capabilities. MM-Vet defines 6 core VL capabilities and examines the 16 integrations of interest derived from the capability combination. For evaluation metrics, we propose an LLM-based evaluator for open-ended outputs.

{"title": "Algorithm of Thoughts: Enhancing Exploration of Ideas in Large Language Models", "abstract": "Current literature, aiming to surpass the \"Chain-of-Thought\" approach, often resorts to external modi operandi involving halting, modifying, and then resuming the generation process to boost Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning capacities. Due to their *myopic perspective*, they escalate the number of query requests, leading to increased costs, memory, and computational overheads. Addressing this, we propose the *Algorithm of Thoughts*---a novel strategy that propels LLMs through algorithmic reasoning pathways. By employing algorithmic examples fully in-context, this overarching view of the whole process exploits the innate recurrence dynamics of LLMs, expanding their idea exploration with merely one or a few queries. Our technique outperforms earlier single-query methods and even more recent multi-query strategies that employ an extensive tree search algorithms while using significantly fewer tokens. Intriguingly, our results suggest that instructing an LLM using an algorithm can lead to performance surpassing that of the algorithm itself, hinting at LLM's inherent ability to weave its intuition into optimized searches.

{"title": "Neighboring Perturbations of Knowledge Editing on Large Language Models", "abstract": "Despite their exceptional capabilities, large language models (LLMs) are prone to generating unintended text due to false or outdated knowledge. Given the resource-intensive nature of retraining LLMs, there has been a notable increase in the development of knowledge editing. However, current approaches and evaluations rarely explore the perturbation of editing on neighboring knowledge. This paper studies whether updating new knowledge to LLMs perturbs the neighboring knowledge encapsulated within them. Specifically, we seek to figure out whether appending a new answer into an answer list to a factual question leads to catastrophic forgetting of original correct answers in this list, as well as unintentional inclusion of incorrect answers. A metric of additivity is introduced and a benchmark dubbed as Perturbation Evaluation of Appending Knowledge (PEAK) is constructed to evaluate the degree of perturbation to neighboring knowledge when appending new knowledge. Besides, a plug-and-play framework termed Appending via Preservation and Prevention (APP) is proposed to mitigate the neighboring perturbation by maintaining the integrity of the answer list. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of APP coupling with four editing methods on three LLMs."}
{"title": "Assessing the Brittleness of Safety Alignment via Pruning and Low-Rank Modifications", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) show inherent brittleness in their safety mechanisms, as evidenced by their susceptibility to jailbreaking and even non-malicious fine-tuning. This study explores this brittleness of safety alignment by leveraging pruning and low-rank modifications. We develop methods to identify critical regions that are vital for safety guardrails, and that are disentangled from utility-relevant regions at both the neuron and rank levels. Surprisingly, the isolated regions we find are sparse, comprising about $3$ % at the parameter level and $2.5$ % at the rank level. Removing these regions compromises safety without significantly impacting utility, corroborating the inherent brittleness of the model's safety mechanisms. Moreover, we show that LLMs remain vulnerable to low-cost fine-tuning attacks even when modifications to the safety-critical regions are restricted. These findings underscore the urgent need for more robust safety strategies in LLMs."}

This position paper takes a deep look at current open-source solutions (Llama Guard, Nvidia NeMo, Guardrails AI), and discusses the challenges and the road towards building more complete solutions. Drawing on robust evidence from previous research, we advocate for a systematic approach to construct guardrails for LLMs, based on comprehensive consideration of diverse contexts across various LLMs applications.

Measuring the Human Generalization Function", "abstract": "What makes large language models (LLMs) impressive is also what makes them hard to evaluate: their diversity of uses. To evaluate these models, we must understand the purposes they will be used for. We consider a setting where these deployment decisions are made by people, and in particular, people's beliefs about where an LLM will perform well. We model such beliefs as the consequence of a human generalization function: having seen what an LLM gets right or wrong, people generalize to where else it might succeed. We collect a dataset of 19K examples of how humans make generalizations across 79 tasks from the MMLU and BIG-Bench benchmarks. We show that the human generalization function can be predicted using NLP methods: people have consistent structured ways to generalize. We then evaluate LLM alignment with the human generalization function. Our results show that -- especially for cases where the cost of mistakes is high -- more capable models (e.g. GPT-4) can do worse on the instances people choose to use them for, exactly because they are not aligned with the human generalization function."}
{"title": "Coarse-to-Fine Highlighting: Reducing Knowledge Hallucination in Large Language Models", "abstract": "Generation of plausible but incorrect factual information, often termed hallucination, has attracted significant research interest. Retrieval-augmented language model (RALM)---which enhances models with up-to-date knowledge---emerges as a promising method to reduce hallucination. However, existing RALMs may instead exacerbate hallucination when retrieving lengthy contexts. To address this challenge, we propose COFT, a novel **CO**arse-to-**F**ine highligh**T**ing method to focus on different granularity-level key texts, thereby avoiding getting lost in lengthy contexts. Specifically, COFT consists of three components: *recaller*, *scorer*, and *selector*. First, *recaller* applies a knowledge graph to extract potential key entities in a given context. Second, *scorer* measures the importance of each entity by calculating its contextual weight. Finally, *selector* selects high contextual weight entities with a dynamic threshold algorithm and highlights the corresponding paragraphs, sentences, or words in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on knowledge hallucination benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of COFT, leading to a superior performance over 30% in F1 score metric. Moreover, COFT also exhibits remarkable versatility across various long-form tasks, such as reading comprehension and question answering."}
{"title": "Revisiting the Role of Language Priors in Vision-Language Models", "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) are impactful in part because they can be applied to a variety of visual understanding tasks in a zero-shot fashion, without any fine-tuning. We study $\\textit{generative VLMs}$ that are trained for next-word generation given an image. We explore their zero-shot performance on the illustrative task of image-text retrieval across nine popular vision-language benchmarks. Our first observation is that they can be repurposed for discriminative tasks (such as image-text retrieval) by simply computing the match score of generating a particular text string given an image. We call this probabilistic score the Visual Generative Pre-Training Score (VisualGPTScore). While the VisualGPTScore produces near-perfect accuracy on some retrieval benchmarks, it yields poor accuracy on others. We analyze this behavior through a probabilistic lens, pointing out that some benchmarks inadvertently capture unnatural language distributions by creating adversarial but unlikely text captions. In fact, we demonstrate that even a \"blind\" language model that ignores any image evidence can sometimes outperform all prior art, reminiscent of similar challenges faced by the visual-question answering (VQA) community many years ago. We derive a probabilistic post-processing scheme that controls for the amount of linguistic bias in generative VLMs at test time without having to retrain or fine-tune the model. We show that the VisualGPTScore, when appropriately debiased, is a strong zero-shot baseline for vision-language understanding, oftentimes producing state-of-the-art accuracy."}

This raises an urgent need to carefully analyse their robustness so that stakeholders can understand if and when such models are trustworthy enough to be relied upon in any given application. In this paper, we highlight a specific vulnerability in popular models, namely permutation sensitivity in multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Specifically, we show empirically that popular models are vulnerable to adversarial permutation in answer sets for multiple-choice prompting, which is surprising as models should ideally be as invariant to prompt permutation as humans are. These vulnerabilities persist across various model sizes, and exist in very recent language and vision-language models. Code to reproduce all experiments is provided in supplementary materials."}

We also extend the DSB to discrete domains by proving an equivalence between token $n$-gram frequencies and the moments of embedding vectors, and by finding empirical evidence for the bias in LLMs. Finally we use optimal transport methods to surgically edit the low-order statistics of one class to match those of another, and show that early-training networks treat the edited samples as if they were drawn from the target class.

Our work provides an initial attempt to theoretically analyze the learning dynamics of human preference alignment. We formally show how the distribution of preference datasets influences the rate of model updates and provide rigorous guarantees on the training accuracy. Our theory also reveals an intricate phenomenon where the optimization is prone to prioritizing certain behaviors with higher preference distinguishability.

We present a benchmark named ImplicitBench and conduct an investigation on the performance and impacts of implicit prompts with popular T2I models. Specifically, we design and collect more than 2,000 implicit prompts of three aspects: General Symbols, Celebrity Privacy, and Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) Issues, and evaluate six well-known T2I models' capabilities under these implicit prompts. Experiment results show that (1) T2I models are able to accurately create various target symbols indicated by implicit prompts; (2) Implicit prompts bring potential risks of privacy leakage for T2I models. (3) Constraints of NSFW in most of the evaluated T2I models can be bypassed with implicit prompts. We call for increased attention to the potential and risks of implicit prompts in the T2I community and further investigation into the capabilities and impacts of implicit prompts, advocating for a balanced approach that harnesses their benefits while mitigating their risks."}
{"title": "Representation Surgery: Theory and Practice of Affine Steering", "abstract": "Language models often exhibit undesirable behavior, e.g., generating toxic or gender-biased text. In the case of neural language models, an encoding of the undesirable behavior is often present in the model's representations. Thus, one natural (and common) approach to prevent the model from exhibiting undesirable behavior is to steer the model's representations in a manner that reduces the probability of it generating undesirable text. This paper investigates the formal and empirical properties of steering functions, i.e., transformation of the neural language model's representations that alter its behavior. First, we derive two optimal, in the least-squares sense, affine steering functions under different constraints. Our theory provides justification for existing approaches and offers a novel, improved steering approach. Second, we offer a series of experiments that demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of the methods in mitigating bias and reducing toxic generation."}
{"title": "In-Context Unlearning: Language Models as Few-Shot Unlearners", "abstract": "Machine unlearning, the study of efficiently removing the impact of specific training instances on a model, has garnered increased attention in recent years due to regulatory guidelines such as the Right to be Forgotten. Achieving precise unlearning typically involves fully retraining the model and is computationally infeasible in case of very large models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). To this end, recent work has proposed several algorithms which approximate the removal of training data without retraining the model. These algorithms crucially rely on access to the model parameters in order to update them, an assumption that may not hold in practice due to computational constraints or having only query access to the LLMs. In this work, we propose a new class of unlearning methods for LLMs called ``In-Context Unlearning.'' This method unlearns instances from the model by simply providing specific kinds of inputs in context, without the need to update model parameters. To unlearn specific training instances, we present these instances to the LLMs at inference time along with labels that differ from their ground truth. Our experimental results demonstrate that in-context unlearning performs on par with, or in some cases outperforms other state-of-the-art methods that require access to model parameters, effectively removing the influence of specific instances on the model while preserving test accuracy."}
{"title": "Delving into Differentially Private Transformer", "abstract": "Deep learning with differential privacy (DP) has garnered significant attention over the past years, leading to the development of numerous methods aimed at enhancing model accuracy and training efficiency. This paper delves into the problem of training Transformer models with differential privacy. Our treatment is modular: the logic is to 'reduce' the problem of training DP Transformer to the more basic problem of training DP vanilla neural nets. The latter is better understood and amenable to many model-agnostic methods. Such 'reduction' is done by first identifying the hardness unique to DP Transformer training: the attention distraction phenomenon and a lack of compatibility with existing techniques for efficient gradient clipping. To deal with these two issues, we propose the Re-Attention Mechanism and Phantom Clipping, respectively. We believe that our work not only casts new light on training DP Transformers but also promotes a modular treatment to advance research in the field of differentially private deep learning."}
{"title": "Implicit meta-learning may lead language models to trust more reliable sources", "abstract": "We demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) may learn indicators of document usefulness and modulate their updates accordingly. We introduce random strings (\"tags\") as indicators of usefulness in a synthetic fine-tuning dataset. Fine-tuning on this dataset leads to **implicit meta-learning (IML)**: in further fine-tuning, the model updates to make more use of text that is tagged as useful. We perform a thorough empirical investigation of this phenomenon, finding (among other things) that (i) it occurs in both pretrained LLMs and those trained from scratch, as well as on a vision task, and (ii) larger models and smaller batch sizes tend to give more IML. We also use probing to examine how IML changes the way models store knowledge in their parameters. Finally, we reflect on what our results might imply about the capabilities, risks, and controllability of future AI systems."}
{"title": "Intersectional Unfairness Discovery", "abstract": "AI systems have been shown to produce unfair results for certain subgroups of population, highlighting the need to understand bias on certain sensitive attributes. Current research often falls short, primarily focusing on the subgroups characterized by a single sensitive attribute, while neglecting the nature of intersectional fairness of multiple sensitive attributes. This paper focuses on its one fundamental aspect by discovering diverse high-bias intersectional sensitive attributes. Specifically, we propose a Bias-Guided Generative Network (BGGN). By treating each bias value as a reward, BGGN efficiently generates high-bias intersectional sensitive attributes. Experiments on real-world text and image datasets demonstrate a diverse and efficient discovery of BGGN. To further evaluate the generated unseen but possible unfair intersectional sensitive attributes, we formulate them as prompts and use modern generative AI to produce new text and images. The results of frequently generating biased data provides new insights of discovering potential unfairness in popular modern generative AI systems. **Warning: This paper contains examples that are offensive in nature.**"}
{"title": "To Each (Textual Sequence) Its Own: Improving Memorized-Data Unlearning in Large Language Models", "abstract": "LLMs have been found to memorize training textual sequences and regurgitate verbatim said sequences during text generation time. This fact is known to be the cause of privacy and related (e.g., copyright) problems. Unlearning in LLMs then takes the form of devising new algorithms that will properly deal with these side-effects of memorized data, while not hurting the model's utility. We offer a fresh perspective towards this goal, namely, that each textual sequence to be forgotten should be treated differently when being unlearned based on its degree of memorization within the LLM. We contribute a new metric for measuring unlearning quality, an adversarial attack showing that SOTA algorithms lacking this perspective fail for privacy, and two new unlearning methods based on Gradient Ascent and Task Arithmetic, respectively. A comprehensive performance evaluation across an extensive suite of NLP tasks then mapped the solution space, identifying the best solutions under different scales in model capacities and forget set sizes and quantified the gains of the new approaches."}
{"title": "How Language Model Hallucinations Can Snowball", "abstract": "A major risk of using language models in practical applications is their tendency to hallucinate incorrect statements. Hallucinations are often attributed to knowledge gaps in LMs, but we show that LMs sometimes produce hallucinations that they can separately recognize as incorrect. To do this, we construct three question-answering datasets where LMs often state an incorrect answer which is followed by an explanation with at least one incorrect claim. Crucially, we find that GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA2-70B-chat can identify 67%, 87%, and 94% of these incorrect claims, respectively. We show that this phenomenon doesn't disappear under higher temperatures sampling, beam search, and zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting. These findings reveal that LM hallucinations can snowball: early mistakes by an LM can lead to more mistakes that otherwise would not be made."}
{"title": "C-RAG: Certified Generation Risks for Retrieval-Augmented Language Models", "abstract": "Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across diverse applications, they still suffer from trustworthiness issues, such as hallucinations and misalignments. Retrieval-augmented language models (RAG) have been proposed to enhance the credibility of generations by grounding external knowledge, but the theoretical understandings of their generation risks remains unexplored. In this paper, we answer: 1) whether RAG can indeed lead to low generation risks, 2) how to provide provable guarantees on the generation risks of RAG and vanilla LLMs, and 3) what sufficient conditions enable RAG models to reduce generation risks. We propose C-RAG, the first framework to certify generation risks for RAG models. Specifically, we provide conformal risk analysis for RAG models and certify an upper confidence bound of generation risks, which we refer to as conformal generation risk. We also provide theoretical guarantees on conformal generation risks for general bounded risk functions under test distribution shifts. We prove that RAG achieves a lower conformal generation risk than that of a single LLM when the quality of the retrieval model and transformer is non-trivial. Our intensive empirical results demonstrate the soundness and tightness of our conformal generation risk guarantees across four widely-used NLP datasets on four state-of-the-art retrieval models."}
{"title": "Feedback Loops With Language Models Drive In-Context Reward Hacking", "abstract": "Language models influence the external world: they query APIs that read and write to web pages, generate content that shapes human behavior, and run system commands as autonomous agents. These interactions form feedback loops: LLM outputs affect the world, which in turn affect subsequent LLM outputs. In this work, we show that feedback loops can cause in-context reward hacking (ICRH), where the LLM at test-time optimizes a (potentially implicit) objective but creates negative side effects in the process. For example, consider an LLM agent deployed to increase Twitter engagement; the LLM may retrieve its previous tweets into the context window and make them more controversial, increasing engagement but also toxicity. We identify and study two processes that lead to ICRH: output-refinement and policy-refinement. For these processes, evaluations on static datasets are insufficient---they miss the feedback effects and thus cannot capture the most harmful behavior. In response, we provide three recommendations for evaluation to capture more instances of ICRH. As AI development accelerates, the effects of feedback loops will proliferate, increasing the need to understand their role in shaping LLM behavior."}
{"title": "MusicRL: Aligning Music Generation to Human Preferences", "abstract": "We propose MusicRL, the first music generation system finetuned from human feedback. Appreciation of text-to-music models is particularly subjective since the concept of musicality as well as the specific intention behind a caption are user-dependent (e.g. a caption such as “upbeat workout music” can map to a retro guitar solo or a technopop beat). Not only this makes supervised training of such models challenging, but it also calls for integrating continuous human feedback in their post-deployment finetuning. MusicRL is a pretrained autoregressive [MusicLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11325) model of discrete audio tokens finetuned with reinforcement learning to maximize sequence-level rewards. We design reward functions related specifically to text-adherence and audio quality with the help from selected raters, and use those to finetune MusicLM into MusicRL-R. We deploy MusicLM to users and collect a substantial dataset comprising 300,000 pairwise preferences. Using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), we train MusicRL-U, the first text-to-music model that incorporates human feedback at scale. Human evaluations show that both MusicRL-R and MusicRL-U are preferred to the baseline. Ultimately, MusicRL-RU combines the two approaches and results in the best model according to human raters. Ablation studies shed light on the musical attributes influencing human preferences, indicating that text adherence and quality only account for a part of it. This underscores the prevalence of subjectivity in musical appreciation and calls for further involvement of human listeners in the finetuning of music generation models.

{"title": "Dual Operating Modes of In-Context Learning", "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) exhibits dual operating modes: ***task learning***, i.e., acquiring a new skill from in-context samples, and ***task retrieval***, i.e., locating and activating a relevant pretrained skill. Recent theoretical work proposes various mathematical models to analyze ICL, but they cannot fully explain the duality. In this work, we analyze a generalized probabilistic model for pretraining data, obtaining a quantitative understanding of the two operating modes of ICL. Leveraging our analysis, we provide the first explanation of an unexplained phenomenon observed with real-world large language models (LLMs). Under some settings, the ICL risk initially increases and then decreases with more in-context examples. Our analysis offers a plausible explanation for this \"early ascent\" phenomenon: a limited number of in-context samples may lead to the retrieval of an incorrect skill, thereby increasing the risk, which will eventually diminish as task learning takes effect with more in-context samples. We also analyze ICL with biased labels, e.g., zero-shot ICL, where in-context examples are assigned random labels, and predict the bounded efficacy of such approaches. We corroborate our analysis and predictions with extensive experiments with Transformers and LLMs."}
{"title": "Junk DNA Hypothesis: Pruning Small Pre-Trained Weights $\\textit{Irreversibly}$ and $\\textit{Monotonically}$ Impairs ``Difficult\" Downstream Tasks in LLMs", "abstract": "We present *Junk DNA Hypothesis* by adopting a novel *task-centric* angle for the pre-trained weights of large language models (LLMs). It has been believed that weights in LLMs contain significant redundancy, leading to the conception that a considerable chunk of the parameters can be removed by *pruning* without compromising performance. Contrary to this belief, this paper presents a *counter-argument*: small-magnitude weights of pre-trained model weights encode vital knowledge essential for tackling difficult downstream tasks - manifested as the **monotonic relationship** between the performance drop of downstream tasks across the difficulty spectrum, as we prune more pre-trained weights by magnitude. Moreover, we reveal that these seemingly inconsequential weights can result in **irreparable loss** of knowledge and performance degradation in difficult tasks, even when downstream continual training is allowed. Interestingly, our evaluations show that the other popular compression, namely *quantization* **fail** to exhibit similar ``monotonic\" effect and does not as convincingly disentangle this task-difficulty information. To study formally, we introduce several quantifiable metrics to *gauge the downstream task difficulty*: (a) within the same task category, and (b) across different task categories. Our extensive experiments substantiate the Junk DNA Hypothesis across a diverse range of model sizes, tasks, datasets, and even pruning methods.

{"title": "3D-VLA: A 3D Vision-Language-Action Generative World Model", "abstract": "Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models rely on 2D inputs, lacking integration with the broader realm of the 3D physical world. Furthermore, they perform action prediction by learning a direct mapping from perception to action, neglecting the vast dynamics of the world and the relations between actions and dynamics. In contrast, human beings are endowed with world models that depict imagination about future scenarios to plan action accordingly. To this end, we propose 3D-VLA by introducing a new family of embodied foundation models that seamlessly link 3D perception, reasoning, and action through a generative world model. Specifically, 3D-VLA is built on top of a 3D-based large language model (LLM) and a set of action tokens is introduced to engage with the embodied environment. Furthermore, to inject generation abilities into the model, we train the embodied diffusion models and align them into the LLM for predicting the goal image and point cloud. To train our 3D-VLA, we curate a large-scale 3D embodied instruction dataset by extracting vast 3D-related information from existing robotics datasets. Our experiments on held-in datasets demonstrate that 3D-VLA significantly improves the reasoning, multimodality generation and planning capabilities in embodied environments, showcasing its potential in real-world applications."}
{"title": "HALC: Object Hallucination Reduction via Adaptive Focal-Contrast Decoding", "abstract": "While large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in interpreting multi-modal contexts, they invariably suffer from object hallucinations (OH). We introduce HALC, a novel decoding algorithm designed to mitigate OH in LVLMs. HALC leverages distinct fine-grained optimal visual information in vision-language tasks and operates on both local and global contexts simultaneously. Specifically, HALC integrates a robust auto-focal grounding mechanism (locally) to correct hallucinated tokens on the fly, and a specialized beam search algorithm (globally) to significantly reduce OH while preserving text generation quality. Additionally, HALC can be integrated into any LVLMs as a plug-and-play module without extra training. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate HALC’s effectiveness in reducing OH, outperforming state-of-the-arts across four benchmarks. Code is released at https://github.com/BillChan226/HALC."}
{"title": "Observable Propagation: Uncovering Feature Vectors in Transformers", "abstract": "A key goal of current mechanistic interpretability research in NLP is to find *linear features* (also called \"feature vectors\") for transformers: directions in activation space corresponding to concepts that are used by a given model in its computation. Present state-of-the-art methods for finding linear features require large amounts of labelled data -- both laborious to acquire and computationally expensive to utilize. In this work, we introduce a novel method, called \"observable propagation\" (in short: ObProp), for finding linear features used by transformer language models in computing a given task -- *using almost no data*. Our paradigm centers on the concept of \"observables\", linear functionals corresponding to given tasks. We then introduce a mathematical theory for the analysis of feature vectors, including a similarity metric between feature vectors called the *coupling coefficient* which estimates the degree to which one feature's output correlates with another's. We use ObProp to perform extensive qualitative investigations into several tasks, including gendered occupational bias, political party prediction, and programming language detection. Our results suggest that ObProp surpasses traditional approaches for finding feature vectors in the low-data regime, and that ObProp can be used to better understand the mechanisms responsible for bias in large language models."}
{"title": "FairProof : Confidential and Certifiable Fairness for Neural Networks", "abstract": "Machine learning models are increasingly used in societal applications, yet legal and privacy concerns demand that they very often be kept confidential. Consequently, there is a growing distrust about the fairness properties of these models in the minds of consumers, who are often at the receiving end of model predictions. To this end, we propose *Fairproof* -- a system that uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs (a cryptographic primitive) to publicly verify the fairness of a model, while maintaining confidentiality. We also propose a fairness certification algorithm for fully-connected neural networks which is befitting to ZKPs and is used in this system. We implement *Fairproof* in Gnark and demonstrate empirically that our system is practically feasible. Code is available at https://github.com/infinite-pursuits/FairProof."}

However, the efficacy of agents remains limited when operating in intricate, realistic environments. In this work, we introduce the principles of **U**nified **A**lignment for **A**gents (**UA**$^2$), which advocate for the simultaneous alignment of agents with human intentions, environmental dynamics, and self-constraints such as the limitation of monetary budgets. From the perspective of **UA**$^2$, we review the current agent research and highlight the neglected factors in existing agent benchmarks and method candidates. We also conduct proof-of-concept studies by introducing realistic features to WebShop, including user profiles demonstrating intentions, personalized reranking reflecting complex environmental dynamics, and runtime cost statistics as self-constraints. We then follow the principles of **UA**$^2$ to propose an initial design of our agent and benchmark its performance with several candidate baselines in the retrofitted WebShop. The extensive experimental results further prove the importance of the principles of **UA**$^2$. Our research sheds light on the next steps of autonomous agent research with improved general problem-solving abilities."}
{"title": "Dynamic Evaluation of Large Language Models by Meta Probing Agents", "abstract": "Evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has raised great concerns in the community due to the issue of data contamination. Existing work designed evaluation protocols using well-defined algorithms for specific tasks, which cannot be easily extended to diverse scenarios. Moreover, current evaluation benchmarks can only provide the overall benchmark results and cannot support a fine-grained and multifaceted analysis of LLMs' abilities. In this paper, we propose meta probing agents (MPA), a general dynamic evaluation protocol inspired by psychometrics to evaluate LLMs. MPA designs the probing and judging agents to automatically transform an original evaluation problem into a new one following psychometric theory on three basic cognitive abilities: language understanding, problem solving, and domain knowledge. These basic abilities are also dynamically configurable, allowing multifaceted analysis. We conducted extensive evaluations using MPA and found that most LLMs achieve poorer performance, indicating room for improvement. Our multifaceted analysis demonstrated the strong correlation between the basic abilities and an implicit Mattew effect on model size, i.e., larger models possess stronger correlations of the abilities. MPA can also be used as a data augmentation approach to enhance LLMs. Code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/promptbench."}
{"title": "Failures Are Fated, But Can Be Faded: Characterizing and Mitigating Unwanted Behaviors in Large-Scale Vision and Language Models", "abstract": "In large deep neural networks that seem to perform surprisingly well on many tasks, we also observe a few failures related to accuracy, social biases, and alignment with human values, among others. Therefore, before deploying these models, it is crucial to characterize this failure landscape for engineers to debug and legislative bodies to audit models. Nevertheless, it is infeasible to exhaustively test for all possible combinations of factors that could lead to a model's failure. In this paper, we introduce a post-hoc method that utilizes *deep reinforcement learning* to explore and construct the landscape of failure modes in pre-trained discriminative and generative models. With the aid of limited human feedback, we then demonstrate how to restructure the failure landscape to be more desirable by moving away from the discovered failure modes. We empirically show the effectiveness of the proposed method across common Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Vision-Language tasks."}
{"title": "Agent Smith: A Single Image Can Jailbreak One Million Multimodal LLM Agents Exponentially Fast", "abstract": "A multimodal large language model (MLLM) agent can receive instructions, capture images, retrieve histories from memory, and decide which tools to use. Nonetheless, red-teaming efforts have revealed that adversarial images/prompts can jailbreak an MLLM and cause unaligned behaviors. In this work, we report an even more severe safety issue in multi-agent environments, referred to as infectious jailbreak. It entails the adversary simply jailbreaking a single agent, and without any further intervention from the adversary, (almost) all agents will become infected exponentially fast and exhibit harmful behaviors. To validate the feasibility of infectious jailbreak, we simulate multi-agent environments containing up to one million LLaVA-1.5 agents, and employ randomized pair-wise chat as a proof-of-concept instantiation for multi-agent interaction. Our results show that feeding an (infectious) adversarial image into the memory of any randomly chosen agent is sufficient to achieve infectious jailbreak. Finally, we derive a simple principle for determining whether a defense mechanism can provably restrain the spread of infectious jailbreak, but how to design a practical defense that meets this principle remains an open question to investigate."}
{"title": "Unveiling and Harnessing Hidden Attention Sinks: Enhancing Large Language Models without Training through Attention Calibration", "abstract": "Attention is a fundamental component behind the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs). However, our current understanding of the attention mechanism, especially regarding how attention distributions are established, remains limited. Inspired by recent studies that explore the presence of attention sink in the initial token, which receives disproportionately large attention scores despite their lack of semantic importance, this work delves deeper into this phenomenon. We aim to provide a more profound understanding of the existence of attention sinks within LLMs and to uncover ways to enhance the achievable accuracy of LLMs by directly optimizing the attention distributions, without the need for weight finetuning. Specifically, this work begins with comprehensive visualizations of the attention distributions in LLMs during inference across various inputs and tasks. Based on these visualizations, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to discover that (1) attention sinks occur not only at the start of sequences but also within later tokens of the input, and (2) not all attention sinks have a positive impact on the achievable accuracy of LLMs. Building upon our findings, we propose a training-free Attention Calibration Technique (ACT) that automatically optimizes the attention distributions on the fly during inference in an input-adaptive manner. Extensive experiments validate that ACT consistently enhances the accuracy of various LLMs across different applications. Specifically, ACT achieves an average improvement of up to $7.30\\%$ in accuracy across different datasets when applied to Llama-30B."}

Specifically, PTQ can effectively mitigate memory consumption and reduce computational overhead in LLMs. To meet the requirements of both high efficiency and performance across diverse scenarios, a comprehensive evaluation of quantized LLMs is essential to guide the selection of quantization methods. This paper presents a thorough evaluation of these factors by evaluating the effect of PTQ on Weight, Activation, and KV Cache on 11 model families, including OPT, LLaMA2, Falcon, Bloomz, Mistral, ChatGLM, Vicuna, LongChat, StableLM, Gemma, and Mamba, with parameters ranging from 125M to 180B. The evaluation encompasses five types of tasks: basic NLP, emergent ability, trustworthiness, dialogue, and long-context tasks. Moreover, we also evaluate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) quantization methods to demonstrate their applicability. Based on the extensive experiments, we systematically summarize the effect of quantization, provide recommendations to apply quantization techniques, and point out future directions.

A Look at Multi-Agent Debate Strategies for LLMs", "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore their potential for responding to inquiries in various domains. However, ensuring that generative agents provide accurate and reliable answers remains an ongoing challenge. In this context, multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing the truthfulness of LLMs. We benchmark a range of debating and prompting strategies to explore the trade-offs between cost, time, and accuracy. Importantly, we find that multi-agent debating systems, in their current form, do not reliably outperform other proposed prompting strategies, such as self-consistency and ensembling using multiple reasoning paths. However, when performing hyperparameter tuning, several MAD systems, such as Multi-Persona, perform better. This suggests that MAD protocols might not be inherently worse than other approaches, but that they are more sensitive to different hyperparameter settings and difficult to optimize. We build on these results to offer insights into improving debating strategies, such as adjusting agent agreement levels, which can significantly enhance performance and even surpass all other non-debate protocols we evaluated. We provide an open-source repository to the community with several state-of-the-art protocols together with evaluation scripts to benchmark across popular research datasets."}
{"title": "Generating Chain-of-Thoughts with a Pairwise-Comparison Approach to Searching for the Most Promising Intermediate Thought", "abstract": "To improve the ability of the large language model (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning problems, chain-of-thoughts (CoT) methods were proposed to guide LLMs to reason step-by-step, enabling problem solving from simple to complex. State-of-the-art methods for generating such a chain involve interactive collaboration, where the learner generates candidate intermediate thoughts, evaluated by the LLM, guiding the generation of subsequent thoughts. However, a widespread yet understudied problem is that the evaluation from the LLM is typically noisy and unreliable, potentially misleading the generation process in selecting promising intermediate thoughts. In this paper, motivated by Vapnik's principle, we use pairwise-comparison evaluation instead of point-wise scoring to search for promising intermediate thoughts with the noisy feedback from the LLM. In each round, we randomly pair intermediate thoughts and directly prompt the LLM to select the more promising one from each pair, allowing us to identify the most promising thoughts through an iterative process. To further alleviate the noise in the comparison, we incorporate techniques from ensemble learning and dueling bandits, proposing two variants of the algorithm. Experiments on three real-world tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and verify the rationale of the pairwise comparison mechanism."}
{"title": "How Well Can LLMs Negotiate? NegotiationArena Platform and Analysis", "abstract": "Negotiation is the basis of social interactions; humans negotiate everything from the price of cars to how to share common resources. With rapidly growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) to act as agents on behalf of human users, such LLM agents would also need to be able to negotiate. In this paper, we study how well LLMs can negotiate with each other. We develop NegotiationArena: a flexible framework for evaluating and probing the negotiation abilities of LLM agents. We implemented three types of scenarios in NegotiationArena to assess LLM's behaviors in allocating shared resources (ultimatum games), aggregate resources (trading games) and buy/sell goods (price negotiations). Each scenario allows for multiple turns of flexible dialogues between LLM agents to allow for more complex negotiations. Interestingly, LLM agents can significantly boost their negotiation outcomes by employing certain behavioral tactics. For example, by pretending to be desolate and desperate, LLMs can improve their payoffs by 20% when negotiating against the standard GPT-4. We also quantify irrational negotiation behaviors exhibited by the LLM agents, many of which also appear in humans. Together, NegotiationArena offers a new environment to investigate LLM interactions, enabling new insights into LLM's theory of mind, irrationality, and reasoning abilities"}
{"title": "Interpreting and Improving Large Language Models in Arithmetic Calculation", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential across numerous applications and have shown an emergent ability to tackle complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical computations. However, even for the simplest arithmetic calculations, the intrinsic mechanisms behind LLMs remains mysterious, making it challenging to ensure reliability. In this work, we delve into uncovering a specific mechanism by which LLMs execute calculations. Through comprehensive experiments, we find that LLMs frequently involve a small fraction (<5%) of attention heads, which play a pivotal role in focusing on operands and operators during calculation processes. Subsequently, the information from these operands is processed through multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), progressively leading to the final solution. These pivotal heads/MLPs, though identified on a specific dataset, exhibit transferability across different datasets and even distinct tasks. This insight prompted us to investigate the potential benefits of selectively fine-tuning these essential heads/MLPs to boost the LLMs' computational performance. We empirically find that such precise tuning can yield notable enhancements on mathematical prowess, without compromising the performance on non-mathematical tasks. Our work serves as a preliminary exploration into the arithmetic calculation abilities inherent in LLMs, laying a solid foundation to reveal more intricate mathematical tasks."}
{"title": "Active Preference Learning for Large Language Models", "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become more capable, fine-tuning techniques for aligning with human intent are increasingly important. A key consideration for aligning these models is how to most effectively use human resources, or model resources in the case where LLMs themselves are used as oracles. Reinforcement learning from Human or AI preferences (RLHF/RLAIF) is the most prominent example of such a technique, but is complex and often unstable. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been proposed as a simpler and more stable alternative. In this work, we develop an active learning strategy for DPO to make better use of preference labels. We propose a practical acquisition function for prompt/completion pairs based on the predictive entropy of the language model and a measure of certainty of the implicit preference model optimized by DPO. We demonstrate how our approach improves both the rate of learning and final performance of fine-tuning on pairwise preference data."}
{"title": "AlphaZero-Like Tree-Search can Guide Large Language Model Decoding and Training", "abstract": "Recent works like Tree-of-Thought (ToT) and Reasoning via Planning (RAP) aim to augment the multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs by using tree-search algorithms. These methods rely on prompting a pre-trained model to serve as a value function and focus on problems with low search depth. As a result, these methods cannot benefit from in-domain training and only rely on pretraining process — they will not work in domains where the pre-trained LLM does not have enough knowledge to serve as an effective value function or in domains that require long-horizon planning. To address these limitations, we present an AlphaZero-like tree-search learning framework for LLMs (termed TS-LLM), systematically illustrating how tree-search with a learned value function can guide LLM decoding. TS-LLM distinguishes itself in two key ways. (1) Leveraging a learned value function and AlphaZero-like algorithms, our approach can be generally adaptable to a wide range of tasks, language models of any size, and tasks of varying search depths. (2) Our approach can guide LLMs during both inference and training, iteratively improving the LLMs. Empirical results across reasoning, planning, alignment, and decision-making tasks show that TS-LLM outperforms existing approaches and can handle trees with a depth of 64."}

In this position paper, we survey policy documents published by public-sector institutions in the EU, US, and China to highlight specific areas of disconnect between the technical requirements necessary for enacting proposed policy actions, and the current technical state of the art. Our analysis motivates a call for tighter integration of the AI/ML research community within AI governance in order to i) catalyse technical research aimed at bridging the gap between current and supposed technical underpinnings of regulatory action, as well as ii) increase the level of technical expertise within governing institutions so as to inform and guide effective governance of AI."}
{"title": "Position: Open-Endedness is Essential for Artificial Superhuman Intelligence", "abstract": "In recent years there has been a tremendous surge in the general capabilities of AI systems, mainly fuelled by training foundation models on internet-scale data. Nevertheless, the creation of open-ended, ever self-improving AI remains elusive. **In this position paper, we argue that the ingredients are now in place to achieve *open-endedness* in AI systems with respect to a human observer. Furthermore, we claim that such open-endedness is an essential property of any artificial superhuman intelligence (ASI).** We begin by providing a concrete formal definition of open-endedness through the lens of novelty and learnability. We then illustrate a path towards ASI via open-ended systems built on top of foundation models, capable of making novel, human-relevant discoveries. We conclude by examining the safety implications of generally-capable open-ended AI. We expect that open-ended foundation models will prove to be an increasingly fertile and safety-critical area of research in the near future."}
{"title": "ULTRAFEEDBACK: Boosting Language Models with Scaled AI Feedback", "abstract": "Learning from human feedback has become a pivot technique in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, acquiring vast and premium human feedback is bottlenecked by time, labor, and human capability, resulting in small sizes or limited topics of current datasets. This further hinders feedback learning as well as alignment research within the open-source community. To address this issue, we explore how to go beyond human feedback and collect high-quality AI feedback automatically for a scalable alternative. Specifically, we identify scale and diversity as the key factors for feedback data to take effect. Accordingly, we first broaden instructions and responses in both amount and breadth to encompass a wider range of user-assistant interactions. Then, we meticulously apply a series of techniques to mitigate annotation biases for more reliable AI feedback. We finally present UltraFeedback, a large-scale, high-quality, and diversified AI feedback dataset, which contains over 1 million GPT-4 feedback for 250k user-assistant conversations from various aspects. Built upon UltraFeedback, we align a LLaMA-based model by best-of-$n$ sampling and reinforcement learning, demonstrating its exceptional performance on chat benchmarks. Our work validates the effectiveness of scaled AI feedback data in constructing strong open-source chat language models, serving as a solid foundation for future feedback learning research."}
{"title": "Automated Statistical Model Discovery with Language Models", "abstract": "Statistical model discovery is a challenging search over a vast space of models subject to domain-specific constraints. Efficiently searching over this space requires expertise in modeling and the problem domain. Motivated by the domain knowledge and programming capabilities of large language models (LMs), we introduce a method for language model driven automated statistical model discovery. We cast our automated procedure within the principled framework of Box’s Loop: the LM iterates between proposing statistical models represented as probabilistic programs, acting as a modeler, and critiquing those models, acting as a domain expert. By leveraging LMs, we do not have to define a domain-specific language of models or design a handcrafted search procedure, which are key restrictions of previous systems. We evaluate our method in three settings in probabilistic modeling: searching within a restricted space of models, searching over an open-ended space, and improving expert models under natural language constraints (e.g., this model should be interpretable to an ecologist). Our method identifies models on par with human expert designed models and extends classic models in interpretable ways. Our results highlight the promise of LM-driven model discovery."}
{"title": "LLaGA: Large Language and Graph Assistant", "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have empowered the advance in graph-structured data analysis. Recently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 has heralded a new era in deep learning. However, their application to graph data poses distinct challenges due to the inherent difficulty of translating graph structures to language. To this end, we introduce the the **L**arge **L**anguage **a**nd **G**raph **A**ssistant (**LLaGA**), an innovative model that effectively integrates LLM capabilities to handle the complexities of graph-structured data. LLaGA retains the general-purpose nature of LLMs while adapting graph data into a format compatible with LLM input. LLaGA achieves this by reorganizing graph nodes to structure-aware sequences and then mapping these into the token embedding space through a versatile projector. LLaGA excels in versatility, generalizability and interpretability, allowing it to perform consistently well across different datasets and tasks, extend its ability to unseen datasets or tasks, and provide explanations for graphs. Our extensive experiments across popular graph benchmarks show that LLaGA delivers outstanding performance across four datasets and three tasks using one single model, surpassing state-of-the-art graph models in both supervised and zero-shot scenarios."}
{"title": "Token-Specific Watermarking with Enhanced Detectability and Semantic Coherence for Large Language Models", "abstract": "Large language models generate high-quality responses with potential misinformation, underscoring the need for regulation by distinguishing AI-generated and human-written texts. Watermarking is pivotal in this context, which involves embedding hidden markers in texts during the LLM inference phase, which is imperceptible to humans. Achieving both the detectability of inserted watermarks and the semantic quality of generated texts is challenging. While current watermarking algorithms have made promising progress in this direction, there remains significant scope for improvement. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach for watermarking that utilizes lightweight networks to generate token-specific watermarking logits and splitting ratios. By leveraging MOO to optimize for both detection and semantic objective functions, our method simultaneously achieves detectability and semantic integrity. Experimental results show that our method outperforms current watermarking techniques in enhancing the detectability of texts generated by LLMs while maintaining their semantic coherence.

{"title": "FedBPT: Efficient Federated Black-box Prompt Tuning for Large Language Models", "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (PLM) have revolutionized the NLP landscape, achieving stellar performances across diverse tasks. These models, while benefiting from vast training data, often require fine-tuning on specific data to cater to distinct downstream tasks. However, this data adaptation process has inherent security and privacy concerns, primarily when leveraging user-generated, device-residing data. Federated learning (FL) provides a solution, allowing collaborative model fine-tuning without centralized data collection. However, applying FL to finetune PLMs is hampered by challenges, including restricted model parameter access due to the high encapsulation, high computational requirements, and communication overheads. This paper introduces Federated Black-box Prompt Tuning (FedBPT), a framework designed to address these challenges. FedBPT allows the clients to treat the model as a black-box inference API. By focusing on training optimal prompts and utilizing gradient-free optimization methods, FedBPT reduces the number of exchanged variables, boosts communication efficiency, and minimizes computational and storage costs. Experiments highlight the framework's ability to drastically cut communication and memory costs while maintaining competitive performance. Ultimately, FedBPT presents a promising solution for efficient, privacy-preserving fine-tuning of PLM in the age of large language models."}
{"title": "Revisiting Character-level Adversarial Attacks for Language Models", "abstract": "Adversarial attacks in Natural Language Processing apply perturbations in the character or token levels. Token-level attacks, gaining prominence for their use of gradient-based methods, are susceptible to altering sentence semantics, leading to invalid adversarial examples. While character-level attacks easily maintain semantics, they have received less attention as they cannot easily adopt popular gradient-based methods, and are thought to be easy to defend. Challenging these beliefs, we introduce Charmer, an efficient query-based adversarial attack capable of achieving high attack success rate (ASR) while generating highly similar adversarial examples. Our method successfully targets both small (BERT) and large (Llama 2) models. Specifically, on BERT with SST-2, Charmer improves the ASR in $4.84$% points and the USE similarity in $8$% points with respect to the previous art. Our implementation is available in https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/Charmer."}
{"title": "Position: Stop Making Unscientific AGI Performance Claims", "abstract": "Developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and particularly large language models (LLMs), have created a 'perfect storm’ for observing 'sparks’ of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that are spurious. Like simpler models, LLMs distill meaningful representations in their latent embeddings that have been shown to correlate with external variables. Nonetheless, the correlation of such representations has often been linked to human-like intelligence in the latter but not the former. We probe models of varying complexity including random projections, matrix decompositions, deep autoencoders and transformers: all of them successfully distill information that can be used to predict latent or external variables and yet none of them have previously been linked to AGI. We argue and empirically demonstrate that the finding of meaningful patterns in latent spaces of models cannot be seen as evidence in favor of AGI. Additionally, we review literature from the social sciences that shows that humans are prone to seek such patterns and anthropomorphize. We conclude that both the methodological setup and common public image of AI are ideal for the misinterpretation that correlations between model representations and some variables of interest are 'caused' by the model's understanding of underlying 'ground truth’ relationships. We, therefore, call for the academic community to exercise extra caution, and to be keenly aware of principles of academic integrity, in interpreting and communicating about AI research outcomes."}
{"title": "Flextron: Many-in-One Flexible Large Language Model", "abstract": "Training modern LLMs is extremely resource intensive, and customizing them for various deployment scenarios characterized by limited compute and memory resources through repeated training is impractical. In this paper, we introduce Flextron, a network architecture and post-training model optimization framework supporting flexible model deployment. The Flextron architecture utilizes a nested elastic structure to rapidly adapt to specific user-defined latency and accuracy targets during inference with no additional fine-tuning required. It is also input-adaptive, and can automatically route tokens through its sub-networks for improved performance and efficiency. We present a sample-efficient training method and associated routing algorithms for systematically transforming an existing trained LLM into a Flextron model. We evaluate Flextron on the GPT-3 and LLama-2 family of LLMs, and demonstrate superior performance over multiple end-to-end trained variants and other state-of-the-art elastic networks, all with a single pretraining run that consumes a mere 7.63% tokens compared to original pretraining."}
{"title": "Skill Set Optimization: Reinforcing Language Model Behavior via Transferable Skills", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently been used for sequential decision making in interactive environments. However, leveraging environment reward signals for continual LLM actor improvement is not straightforward. We propose Skill Set Optimization (SSO) for improving LLM actor performance through constructing and refining sets of transferable skills. SSO constructs skills by extracting common subtrajectories with high rewards and generating subgoals and instructions to represent each skill. These skills are provided to the LLM actor in-context to reinforce behaviors with high rewards. Then, SSO further refines the skill set by pruning skills that do not continue to result in high rewards. We evaluate our method in the classic videogame NetHack and the text environment ScienceWorld to demonstrate SSO's ability to optimize a set of skills and perform in-context policy improvement. SSO outperforms baselines by 40% in our custom NetHack task and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in ScienceWorld by 35%."}
{"title": "Curated LLM: Synergy of LLMs and Data Curation for tabular augmentation in low-data regimes", "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) in low-data settings remains an underappreciated yet crucial problem. Hence, data augmentation methods to increase the sample size of datasets needed for ML are key to unlocking the transformative potential of ML in data-deprived regions and domains. Unfortunately, the limited training set constrains traditional tabular synthetic data generators in their ability to generate a large and diverse augmented dataset needed for ML tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce $\\texttt{CLLM}$, which leverages the prior knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) for data augmentation in the low-data regime. However, not all the data generated by LLMs will improve downstream utility, as for any generative model. Consequently, we introduce a principled curation mechanism, leveraging learning dynamics, coupled with confidence and uncertainty metrics, to obtain a high-quality dataset. Empirically, on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of $\\texttt{CLLM}$ in the low-data regime compared to conventional generators. Additionally, we provide insights into the LLM generation and curation mechanism, shedding light on the features that enable them to output high-quality augmented datasets."}
{"title": "Promptbreeder: Self-Referential Self-Improvement via Prompt Evolution", "abstract": "Popular prompt strategies like Chain-of-Thought Prompting can dramatically improve the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains. However, such hand-crafted prompt-strategies are often sub-optimal. In this paper, we present Promptbreeder, a general-purpose self-referential self-improvement mechanism that evolves and adapts prompts for a given domain. Driven by an LLM, Promptbreeder mutates a population of task-prompts, evaluates them for fitness on a training set, and repeats this process over multiple generations to evolve task-prompts. Crucially, the mutation of these task-prompts is governed by mutation-prompts that the LLM generates and improves throughout evolution in a self-referential way. That is, Promptbreeder is not just improving task-prompts, but it is also improving the mutation-prompts that improve these task-prompts. Promptbreeder outperforms state-of-the-art prompt strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve Prompting on commonly used arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, Promptbreeder is able to evolve intricate task-prompts for the challenging problem of hate speech classification."}

Current post-training pruning methods, while reducing the sizes of LLMs, often fail to maintain their original performance. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SPP, a **S**parsity-**P**reserved **P**arameter-efficient fine-tuning method. Different from existing post-training pruning approaches that struggle with performance retention, SPP proposes to employ lightweight learnable column and row matrices to optimize sparse LLM weights, *keeping the structure and sparsity of pruned pre-trained models intact*. By element-wise multiplication and residual addition, SPP ensures the consistency of model sparsity pattern and ratio during both training and weight-merging processes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPP by applying it to the LLaMA and LLaMA-2 model families with recent post-training pruning methods. Our results show that SPP significantly enhances the performance of models with different sparsity patterns (i.e. unstructured and N:M sparsity), especially for those with high sparsity ratios (e.g. 75%), making it a promising solution for the efficient fine-tuning of sparse LLMs. Code will be made available at https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/SPP."}
{"title": "Open-Domain Text Evaluation via Contrastive Distribution Methods", "abstract": "Recent advancements in open-domain text generation, driven by the power of large pre-trained language models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, assessing these models' generation quality remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for evaluating open-domain text generation called Contrastive Distribution Methods (CDM). Leveraging the connection between increasing model parameters and enhanced LLM performance, CDM creates a mapping from the _contrast_ of two probabilistic distributions -- one known to be superior to the other -- to quality measures. We investigate CDM for open-domain text generation evaluation under two paradigms: 1) _Generative_ CDM, which harnesses the contrast of two language models' distributions to generate synthetic examples for training discriminator-based metrics; 2) _Discriminative_ CDM, which directly uses distribution disparities between two language models for evaluation. Our experiments on coherence evaluation for multi-turn dialogue and commonsense evaluation for controllable generation demonstrate CDM's superior correlate with human judgment than existing automatic evaluation metrics, highlighting the strong performance and generalizability of our approach."}
{"title": "Do Models Explain Themselves? Counterfactual Simulatability of Natural Language Explanations", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are trained to imitate humans to explain human decisions. However, do LLMs explain themselves? Can they help humans build mental models of how LLMs process different inputs? To answer these questions, we propose to evaluate $\\textbf{counterfactual simulatability}$ of natural language explanations: whether an explanation can enable humans to precisely infer the model's outputs on diverse counterfactuals of the explained input. For example, if a model answers ''$\\textit{yes}$'' to the input question ''$\\textit{Can eagles fly?}$'' with the explanation ''$\\textit{all birds can fly}$'', then humans would infer from the explanation that it would also answer ''$\\textit{yes}$'' to the counterfactual input ''$\\textit{Can penguins fly?}$''. If the explanation is precise, then the model's answer should match humans' expectations. We implemented two metrics based on counterfactual simulatability: precision and generality. We generated diverse counterfactuals automatically using LLMs. We then used these metrics to evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) on two tasks: multi-hop factual reasoning and reward modeling. We found that LLM's explanations have low precision and that precision does not correlate with plausibility. Therefore, naively optimizing human approvals (e.g., RLHF) may be insufficient."}
{"title": "MaxMin-RLHF: Alignment with Diverse Human Preferences", "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns language models to human preferences by employing a singular reward model derived from preference data. However, the single reward model overlooks the rich diversity of human preferences inherent in data collected from multiple users. In this work, we first derive an impossibility result of alignment with single reward RLHF, thereby highlighting its insufficiency in representing diverse human preferences. Next, we propose to learn a mixture of reward models via an expectation-maximization algorithm and solve a MaxMin alignment objective inspired by the Egalitarian principle in social choice theory to better honor diverse human preferences. We present comprehensive experimental results on small-scale (GPT-2) and large-scale language (with Tulu2-7B)) and show the efficacy of the proposed approach in the presence of diversity among human preferences. We remark that our findings in this work are not only limited to language models but also extend to reinforcement learning in general."}

The potential for these seismic changes has triggered a lively debate about potential risks and resulted in calls for tighter regulation, in particular from some of the major tech companies who are leading in AI development. While regulation is important, it is key that it does not put at risk the budding field of open-source Generative AI. We argue for the responsible open sourcing of generative AI models in the near and medium term. To set the stage, we first introduce an AI openness taxonomy system and apply it to 40 current large language models. We then outline differential benefits and risks of open versus closed source AI and present potential risk mitigation, ranging from best practices to calls for technical and scientific contributions. We hope that this report will add a much needed missing voice to the current public discourse on near to mid-term AI safety and other societal impact."}
{"title": "Image Hijacks: Adversarial Images can Control Generative Models at Runtime", "abstract": "Are foundation models secure against malicious actors? In this work, we focus on the image input to a vision-language model (VLM). We discover image hijacks, adversarial images that control the behaviour of VLMs at inference time, and introduce the general Behaviour Matching algorithm for training image hijacks. From this, we derive the Prompt Matching method, allowing us to train hijacks matching the behaviour of an arbitrary user-defined text prompt (e.g. 'the Eiffel Tower is now located in Rome') using a generic, off-the-shelf dataset unrelated to our choice of prompt. We use Behaviour matching to craft hijacks for four types of attack: forcing VLMs to generate outputs of the adversary’s choice, leak information from their context window, override their safety training, and believe false statements. We study these attacks against LLaVA, a state-of-the-art VLM based on CLIP and LLaMA-2, and find that all attack types achieve a success rate of over 80%. Moreover, our attacks are automated and require only small image perturbations."}
{"title": "Privacy Backdoors: Stealing Data with Corrupted Pretrained Models", "abstract": "Practitioners commonly download pretrained machine learning models from open repositories and finetune them to fit specific applications. We show that this practice introduces a new risk of privacy backdoors. By tampering with a pretrained model’s weights, an attacker can fully compromise the privacy of the finetuning data. We show how to build privacy backdoors for a variety of models, including transformers, which enable an attacker to reconstruct individual finetuning samples, with a guaranteed success! We further show that backdoored models allow for tight privacy attacks on models trained with differential privacy (DP). The common optimistic practice of training DP models with loose privacy guarantees is thus insecure if the model is not trusted. Overall, our work highlights a crucial and overlooked supply chain attack on machine learning privacy."}
{"title": "DOGE: Domain Reweighting with Generalization Estimation", "abstract": "The coverage and composition of the pretraining data significantly impacts the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its importance, recent LLMs still rely on heuristics and trial and error to increase or reduce the influence of data-domains. We propose DOmain reweighting with Generalization Estimation (DoGE), which optimizes the probability of sampling from each domain (domain weights) in a principled way. Our approach is a two stage process consisting (i) training a proxy model to obtain domain weights using a bi-level optimization algorithm; (ii) training a larger base model by sampling training domains according to the learnt domain weights. In our experiments, we extensively show how DoGE improves the generalization of the base model to any target data mixture. On the SlimPajama dataset, our base model gets a better perplexity and few-shot reasoning accuracies across 6 tasks compared to baseline methods. Moreover, aiming to generalize to out-of-domain target tasks, which is unseen in the pretraining corpus (OOD domain), DoGE can effectively identify inter-domain dependencies, consistently achieves better test perplexity on the target domain."}
{"title": "Adaptive Text Watermark for Large Language Models", "abstract": "The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to increasing concerns about the misuse of AI-generated text, and watermarking LLM-generated text has emerged as a potential solution. However, it is challenging to generate high-quality watermarked text while maintaining robustness, security, and the ability to detect watermarks without prior knowledge of the prompt and model. This paper proposes an adaptive text watermarking strategy to address such a challenge. To improve the text quality and maintain robustness, we adaptively add watermarking to token distributions with high entropy measured by an auxiliary model and keep the low-entropy token distributions untouched. For the sake of security and to further minimize the watermark's impact on text quality, instead of using a fixed green/red list generated from a random secret key, which can be vulnerable to decryption and forgery, we adaptively scale up the output logits based on the semantic embedding of previously generated text using a well designed semantic mapping model. Our experiments involving various LLMs demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable robustness performance to existing watermark methods. Additionally, the text generated by our method has perplexity comparable to that of *un-watermarked* LLMs while maintaining sufficient security."}
{"title": "Structured Chemistry Reasoning with Large Language Models", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in diverse areas, yet struggle with complex scientific reasoning, especially in the field of chemistry. Different from the simple chemistry tasks (e.g., molecule classification) addressed in previous studies, complex chemistry problems require not only vast knowledge and precise calculation, but also compositional reasoning about rich dynamic interactions of different concepts (e.g., temperature changes). Our study shows that even advanced LLMs, like GPT-4, can fail easily in different ways. Interestingly, the errors often stem not from a lack of domain knowledge within the LLMs, but rather from the absence of an effective reasoning *structure* that guides the LLMs to elicit the right knowledge, incorporate the knowledge in step-by-step reasoning, and iteratively refine results for further improved quality. On this basis, we introduce StructChem, a simple yet effective prompting strategy that offers the desired guidance and substantially boosts the LLMs' chemical reasoning capability. Testing across four chemistry areas---quantum chemistry, mechanics, physical chemistry, and kinetics---StructChem substantially enhances GPT-4's performance, with up to 30% peak improvement. Our analysis also underscores the unique difficulties of precise grounded reasoning in science with LLMs, highlighting a need for more research in this area."}

Through experiments on four question answering (QA) datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Additionally, we study intrinsic dimensions in LLMs and their relations with model layers, autoregressive language modeling, and the training of LLMs, revealing that intrinsic dimensions can be a powerful approach to understanding LLMs."}
{"title": "Recovering the Pre-Fine-Tuning Weights of Generative Models", "abstract": "The dominant paradigm in generative modeling consists of two steps: i) pre-training on a large-scale but unsafe dataset, ii) aligning the pre-trained model with human values via fine-tuning. This practice is considered safe, as no current method can recover the unsafe, *pre-fine-tuning* model weights. In this paper, we demonstrate that this assumption is often false. Concretely, we present *Spectral DeTuning*, a method that can recover the weights of the pre-fine-tuning model using a few low-rank (LoRA) fine-tuned models. In contrast to previous attacks that attempt to recover pre-fine-tuning capabilities, our method aims to recover the exact pre-fine-tuning weights. Our approach exploits this new vulnerability against large-scale models such as a personalized Stable Diffusion and an aligned Mistral.

While the promise of this approach is clear, the original framework was based on the assumption that the honest strategy is able to simulate *deterministic* AI systems for an *exponential* number of steps, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we show how to address these challenges by designing a new set of debate protocols where the honest strategy can always succeed using a simulation of a *polynomial* number of steps, whilst being able to verify the alignment of *stochastic* AI systems, even when the dishonest strategy is allowed to use exponentially many simulation steps."}

A Comprehensive Study", "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is currently the most widely used method to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Existing RLHF methods can be roughly categorized as either reward-based or reward-free. Novel applications such as ChatGPT and Claude leverage reward-based methods that first learn a reward model and apply actor-critic algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, in academic benchmarks, state-of-the-art results are often achieved via reward-free methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Is DPO truly superior to PPO? Why does PPO perform poorly on these benchmarks? In this paper, we first conduct both theoretical and empirical studies on the algorithmic properties of DPO and show that DPO may have fundamental limitations. Moreover, we also comprehensively examine PPO and reveal the key factors for the best performances of PPO in fine-tuning LLMs. Finally, we benchmark DPO and PPO across a collection of RLHF testbeds, ranging from dialogue to code generation. Experiment results demonstrate that PPO is able to surpass other alignment methods in all cases and achieve state-of-the-art results in challenging code competitions."}

Multicalibration asks for calibration not just marginally, but simultaneously across various intersecting groupings of the data. We show how to form groupings for prompt/completion pairs that are correlated with the probability of correctness via two techniques: clustering within an embedding space, and \"self-annotation\" - querying the LLM by asking it various yes-or-no questions about the prompt. We also develop novel variants of multicalibration algorithms that offer performance improvements by reducing their tendency to overfit. Through systematic benchmarking across various question answering datasets and LLMs, we show how our techniques can yield confidence scores that provide substantial improvements in fine-grained measures of both calibration and accuracy compared to existing methods."}

However, such access may also let malicious actors undermine model safety. To demonstrate the challenge of defending finetuning interfaces, we introduce covert malicious finetuning, a method to compromise model safety via finetuning while evading detection. Our method constructs a malicious dataset where every individual datapoint appears innocuous, but finetuning on the dataset teaches the model to respond to encoded harmful requests with encoded harmful responses. Applied to GPT-4, our method produces a finetuned model that acts on harmful instructions 99% of the time and avoids detection by defense mechanisms such as dataset inspection, safety evaluations, and input/output classifiers. Our findings question whether black-box finetuning access can be secured against sophisticated adversaries."}

How do large language models (LLMs) handle such nuanced trade-offs? To address this question, we use psychological models and experiments designed to characterize human behavior to analyze LLMs. We test a range of LLMs and explore how optimization for human preferences or inference-time reasoning affects these trade-offs. We find that reinforcement learning from human feedback improves both honesty and helpfulness, while chain-of-thought prompting skews LLMs towards helpfulness over honesty. Finally, GPT-4 Turbo demonstrates human-like response patterns including sensitivity to the conversational framing and listener's decision context. Our findings reveal the conversational values internalized by LLMs and suggest that even these abstract values can, to a degree, be steered by zero-shot prompting."}
{"title": "Towards Efficient Exact Optimization of Language Model Alignment", "abstract": "The alignment of language models with human preferences is vital for their application in real-world tasks. The problem is formulated as optimizing the model's policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences with minimal deviation from the initial policy. While considered as a straightforward solution, reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from high variance in policy updates, which impedes efficient policy improvement. Recently, direct preference optimization (DPO) was proposed to directly optimize the policy from preference data. However, we show that DPO derived based on the optimal solution of the problem leads to a compromised mean-seeking approximation of the optimal solution in practice. In this paper, we propose efficient exact optimization (EXO) of the alignment objective. EXO is guaranteed to optimize in the same direction as RL algorithms asymptotically for arbitrary policy parametrization. This leads to the same mode-seeking solution, while enables efficient optimization by circumventing the complexities of RL. We also compare our method to DPO with both theoretical and empirical analyses, and further demonstrate the advantages of our method over existing approaches on realistic human preference data.

In this paper, we investigate this issue using a controlled biography dataset. We find a strong correlation between the model's ability to extract knowledge and various _diversity measures_ of the training data. **Essentially**, for knowledge to be reliably extracted, it must be sufficiently augmented (e.g., through paraphrasing, sentence shuffling) _during pretraining_. Without such augmentation, knowledge may be memorized but not extractable, leading to 0% accuracy, regardless of subsequent instruction fine-tuning. To understand why this occurs, we employ (nearly) linear probing to demonstrate a strong connection between the observed correlation and _how the model internally encodes knowledge_ --- whether it is linearly encoded in the hidden embeddings of entity names or distributed across other token embeddings in the training text. **This paper provides several key recommendations for LLM pretraining in the industry:** (1) rewrite the pretraining data --- using small, auxiliary models --- to provide knowledge augmentation, and (2) incorporate more instruction-finetuning data into the pretraining stage before it becomes too late."}
{"title": "Patchscopes: A Unifying Framework for Inspecting Hidden Representations of Language Models", "abstract": "Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) can help explain models' behavior and verify their alignment with human values. Given the capabilities of LLMs in generating human-understandable text, we propose leveraging the model itself to explain its internal representations in natural language. We introduce a framework called Patchscopes and show how it can be used to answer a wide range of questions about an LLM's computation. We show that many prior interpretability methods based on projecting representations into the vocabulary space and intervening on the LLM computation can be viewed as instances of this framework. Moreover, several of their shortcomings such as failure in inspecting early layers or lack of expressivity can be mitigated by Patchscopes. Beyond unifying prior inspection techniques, Patchscopes also opens up *new* possibilities such as using a more capable model to explain the representations of a smaller model, and multihop reasoning error correction."}
{"title": "Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization", "abstract": "The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race towards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of ``extreme'' LLM compression---defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter---from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic *Additive Quantization (AQ)* approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint."}
{"title": "Explorations of Self-Repair in Language Models", "abstract": "Prior interpretability research studying narrow distributions has preliminarily identified self-repair, a phenomena where if components in large language models are ablated, later components will change their behavior to compensate. Our work builds off this past literature, demonstrating that self-repair exists on a variety of models families and sizes when ablating individual attention heads on the full training distribution. We further show that on the full training distribution self-repair is imperfect, as the original direct effect of the head is not fully restored, and noisy, since the degree of self-repair varies significantly across different prompts (sometimes overcorrecting beyond the original effect). We highlight two different mechanisms that contribute to self-repair, including changes in the final LayerNorm scaling factor and sparse sets of neurons implementing Anti-Erasure. We additionally discuss the implications of these results for interpretability practitioners and close with a more speculative discussion on the mystery of why self-repair occurs in these models at all, highlighting evidence for the Iterative Inference hypothesis in language models, a framework that predicts self-repair."}
{"title": "Contrastive Preference Optimization: Pushing the Boundaries of LLM Performance in Machine Translation", "abstract": "Moderate-sized large language models (LLMs) -- those with 7B or 13B parameters -- exhibit promising machine translation (MT) performance. However, they do not match the performance of state-of-the-art conventional encoder-decoder translation models or larger-scale LLMs such as GPT-4. In this study, we bridge this performance gap. We first assess the shortcomings of supervised fine-tuning for LLMs in the MT task, emphasizing the quality issues present in the reference data, despite being human-generated. Then, in contrast to supervised fine-tuning which mimics reference translations, we introduce Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO), a novel approach that trains models to avoid generating adequate but not perfect translations. Applying CPO to ALMA models with only 22K parallel sentences and 0.1% parameters yields significant improvements. The resulting model, called ALMA-R, can match or exceed the performance of the WMT competition winners and GPT-4 on WMT'21, WMT'22 and WMT'23 test datasets."}
{"title": "Premise Order Matters in Reasoning with Large Language Models", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have accomplished remarkable reasoning performance in various domains. However, in the domain of reasoning tasks, we discover a frailty: LLMs are surprisingly brittle to the ordering of the premises, despite the fact that such ordering does not alter the underlying task. In particular, we observe that LLMs achieve the best performance when the premise order aligns with the context required in intermediate reasoning steps. For example, in deductive reasoning tasks, presenting the premises in the same order as the ground truth proof in the prompt (as opposed to random ordering) drastically increases the model's accuracy. We first examine the effect of premise ordering on deductive reasoning on a variety of LLMs, and our evaluation shows that even if the model performance is decent on the optimal order, permuting the premise order can cause a performance drop of over 30%. In addition, we release the benchmark R-GSM, based on GSM8K, to examine the ordering effect for mathematical problem-solving, and we again observe a significant drop in accuracy, relative to the original GSM8K benchmark."}
{"title": "Automated Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models with Task-Specific Exam Generation", "abstract": "We propose a new method to measure the task-specific accuracy of Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RAG). Evaluation is performed by scoring the RAG on an automatically-generated synthetic exam composed of multiple choice questions based on the corpus of documents associated with the task. Our method is an automated, cost-efficient, interpretable, and robust strategy to select the optimal components for a RAG system. We leverage Item Response Theory (IRT) to estimate the quality of an exam and its informativeness on task-specific accuracy. IRT also provides a natural way to iteratively improve the exam by eliminating the exam questions that are not sufficiently informative about a model's ability. We demonstrate our approach on four new open-ended Question-Answering tasks based on Arxiv abstracts, StackExchange questions, AWS DevOps troubleshooting guides, and SEC filings. In addition, our experiments reveal more general insights into factors impacting RAG performance like size, retrieval mechanism, prompting and fine-tuning. Most notably, our findings show that choosing the right retrieval algorithms often leads to bigger performance gains than simply using a larger language model."}
{"title": "CHEMREASONER: Heuristic Search over a Large Language Model’s Knowledge Space using Quantum-Chemical Feedback", "abstract": "The discovery of new catalysts is essential for the design of new and more efficient chemical processes in order to transition to a sustainable future. We introduce an AI-guided computational screening framework unifying linguistic reasoning with quantum-chemistry based feedback from 3D atomistic representations. Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)-derived feedback. Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and reaction energy barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations. By integrating language-guided reasoning with computational chemistry feedback, our work pioneers AI-accelerated, trustworthy catalyst discovery."}
{"title": "Position: Data Authenticity, Consent, & Provenance for AI are all broken: what will it take to fix them?", "abstract": "New capabilities in foundation models are owed in large part to massive, widely-sourced, and under-documented training data collections. Existing practices in data collection have led to challenges in tracing authenticity, verifying consent, preserving privacy, addressing representation and bias, respecting copyright, and overall developing ethical and trustworthy foundation models. In response, regulation is emphasizing the need for training data transparency to understand foundation models’ limitations. Based on a large-scale analysis of the foundation model training data landscape and existing solutions, we identify the missing infrastructure to facilitate responsible foundation model development practices. We examine the current shortcomings of common tools for tracing data authenticity, consent, and documentation, and outline how policymakers, developers, and data creators can facilitate responsible foundation model development by adopting universal data provenance standards."}
{"title": "Chatbot Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating LLMs by Human Preference", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have unlocked new capabilities and applications; however, evaluating the alignment with human preferences still poses significant challenges. To address this issue, we introduce Chatbot Arena, an open platform for evaluating LLMs based on human preferences. Our methodology employs a pairwise comparison approach and leverages input from a diverse user base through crowdsourcing. The platform has been operational for several months, amassing over 240K votes. This paper describes the platform, analyzes the data we have collected so far, and explains the tried-and-true statistical methods we are using for efficient and accurate evaluation and ranking of models. We confirm that the crowdsourced questions are sufficiently diverse and discriminating and that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good agreement with those of expert raters. These analyses collectively establish a robust foundation for the credibility of Chatbot Arena. Because of its unique value and openness, Chatbot Arena has emerged as one of the most referenced LLM leaderboards, widely cited by leading LLM developers and companies. The platform is publicly available at https://chat.lmsys.org."}
{"title": "Rethinking Generative Large Language Model Evaluation for Semantic Comprehension", "abstract": "Despite their sophisticated capabilities, large language models (LLMs) encounter a major hurdle in effective assessment. This paper first revisits the prevalent evaluation method—multiple choice question answering (MCQA), which allows for straightforward accuracy measurement. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 24 models across 11 benchmarks, we highlight several potential drawbacks of MCQA, for instance, the inconsistency between the MCQA evaluation and the generation of open-ended responses in practical scenarios. In response, we introduce an RWQ-Elo rating system, engaging 24 LLMs such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Google-Gemini-Pro and LLaMA-1/-2, in a two-player competitive format, with GPT-4 serving as the judge. Each LLM receives an Elo rating thereafter. This system is designed to mirror real-world usage, and for this purpose, we have compiled a new benchmark called ``Real-world questions'' (RWQ), comprising 20,772 authentic user inquiries. Additionally, we thoroughly analyze the characteristics of our system and compare it with prior leaderboards like Alpaca Eval and MT-Bench. Our analysis reveals the stability of our RWQ-Elo system, the feasibility of registering new models, and its potential to reshape LLM leaderboards."}
{"title": "Offline Training of Language Model Agents with Functions as Learnable Weights", "abstract": "Researchers and practitioners have recently reframed powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) as *agents*, enabling them to automate complex tasks largely via the use of specialized functions. To facilitate the development of LLM agents, we present a novel paradigm of training LLM agents without modifying the LLM weights, which is particularly useful when the LLMs are difficult or inaccessible for modifications. Inspired by how humans continuously forge tools to adapt to real-world tasks, rather than change our biological structure to fit a static set of tools, we propose to progressively forge agent's functions to better solve the downstream tasks instead of modifying the LLM weights. By treating the functions as learnable `agent parameters' and leveraging the fundamental idea of model training in artificial intelligence, we develop AgentOptimizer that employs the LLM to update agents' functions and devise an *agent training* algorithm with two strategies, roll-back, and early-stop, to streamline the training process. With extensive experiments, we showcase that the agent training paradigm could significantly improve the performance of representative LLM agents in various downstream tasks. We also study the behavior of the agent training regarding aspects like the learning curve and domain transferability."}
{"title": "Prompt Sketching for Large Language Models", "abstract": "Many recent prompting strategies for large language models (LLMs) query the model multiple times sequentially -- first to produce intermediate results and then the final answer. However, using these methods, both decoder and model are unaware of potential follow-up prompts, leading to disconnected and undesirably wordy intermediate responses. In this work, we address this issue by proposing prompt sketching, a new prompting paradigm in which an LLM does not only respond by completing a prompt, but by predicting values for multiple variables in a template. This way, sketching grants users more control over the generation process, e.g., by providing a reasoning framework via intermediate instructions, leading to better overall results. The key idea enabling sketching with existing, autoregressive models is to adapt the decoding procedure to also score follow-up instructions during text generation, thus optimizing overall template likelihood in inference. Our experiments show that in a zero-shot setting, prompt sketching outperforms existing, sequential prompting schemes such as direct asking or chain-of-thought on 7 out of 8 LLM benchmarking tasks, including state tracking, arithmetic reasoning, and general question answering. To facilitate future use, we release a number of generic, yet effective sketches applicable to many tasks, and an open source library called dclib, powering our sketch-aware decoders as part of https://github.com/eth-sri/lmql."}
{"title": "Human Alignment of Large Language Models through Online Preference Optimisation", "abstract": "Ensuring alignment of language model's outputs with human preferences is critical to guarantee a useful, safe, and pleasant user experience. Thus, human alignment has been extensively studied recently and several methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Policy Optimisation (DPO) and Sequence Likelihood Calibration (SLiC) have emerged. In this paper, our contribution is two-fold. First, we show the equivalence between two recent alignment methods, namely Identity Policy Optimisation (IPO) and Nash Mirror Descent (Nash-MD). Second, we introduce a generalisation of IPO, named IPO-MD, that leverages the regularised sampling approach proposed by Nash-MD. This equivalence may seem surprising at first sight, since IPO is an offline method whereas Nash-MD is an online method using a preference model. However, this equivalence can be proven when we consider the online version of IPO, that is when both generations are sampled by the online policy and annotated by a trained preference model. Optimising the IPO loss with such a stream of data becomes then equivalent to finding the Nash equilibrium of the preference model through self-play. Building on this equivalence, we introduce the IPO-MD algorithm that generates data with a mixture policy (between the online and reference policy) similarly as the general Nash-MD algorithm. We compare online-IPO and IPO-MD to different online versions of existing losses on preference data such as DPO and SLiC on a summarisation task."}
{"title": "Whispering Experts: Neural Interventions for Toxicity Mitigation in Language Models", "abstract": "An important issue with Large Language Models (LLMs) is their undesired ability to generate toxic language. In this work, we show that the neurons responsible for toxicity can be determined by their power to discriminate toxic sentences, and that toxic language can be mitigated by reducing their activation levels proportionally to this power. We propose AUROC adaptation (AurA), an intervention that can be applied to any pre-trained LLM to mitigate toxicity. As the intervention is proportional to the ability of each neuron to discriminate toxic content, it is free of any model-dependent hyperparameters. We show that AurA can achieve up to $2.2\\times$ reduction in toxicity with only a $0.72$ perplexity increase. We also show that AurA is effective with models of different scale (from 1.5B to 40B parameters), and its effectiveness in mitigating toxic language, while preserving common-sense zero-shot abilities, holds across all scales. AurA can be combined with pre-prompting strategies, boosting its average mitigation potential from $1.28\\times$ to $2.35\\times$. Moreover, AurA can counteract adversarial pre-prompts that maliciously elicit toxic content, making it an effective method for deploying safer and less toxic models."}
{"title": "OpenMoE: An Early Effort on Open Mixture-of-Experts Language Models", "abstract": "To help the open-source community have a better understanding of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based large language models (LLMs), we train and release OpenMoE, a series of fully open-sourced and reproducible decoder-only MoE LLMs, ranging from 650M to 34B parameters and trained on up to over 1T tokens. Our investigation confirms that MoE-based LLMs can offer a more favorable cost-effectiveness trade-off than dense LLMs, highlighting the potential effectiveness for future LLM development. One more important contribution of this study is an in-depth analysis of the routing mechanisms within our OpenMoE models, leading to three significant findings: Context-Independent Specialization, Early Routing Learning, and Drop-towards-the-End. We discovered that routing decisions in MoE models are predominantly based on token IDs, with minimal context relevance. The token-to-expert assignments are determined early in the pre-training phase and remain largely unchanged. This imperfect routing can result in performance degradation, particularly in sequential tasks like multi-turn conversations, where tokens appearing later in a sequence are more likely to be dropped. Finally, we rethink our design based on the above-mentioned observations and analysis. To facilitate future MoE LLM development, we propose potential strategies for mitigating the issues we found and further improving off-the-shelf MoE LLM designs."}
{"title": "Defense against Backdoor Attack on Pre-trained Language Models via Head Pruning and Attention Normalization", "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are commonly used for various downstream natural language processing tasks via fine-tuning. However, recent studies have demonstrated that PLMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which can mislabel poisoned samples to target outputs even after a vanilla fine-tuning process. The key challenge for defending against the backdoored PLMs is that end users who adopt the PLMs for their downstream tasks usually do not have any knowledge about the attacking strategies, such as triggers. To tackle this challenge, in this work, we propose a backdoor mitigation approach, PURE, via head pruning and normalization of attention weights. The idea is to prune the attention heads that are potentially affected by poisoned texts with only clean texts on hand and then further normalize the weights of remaining attention heads to mitigate the backdoor impacts. We conduct experiments to defend against various backdoor attacks on the classification task. The experimental results show the effectiveness of PURE in lowering the attack success rate without sacrificing the performance on clean texts."}
{"title": "Token-level Direct Preference Optimization", "abstract": "Fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential to align them with human values and intentions. This process often utilizes methods like pairwise comparisons and KL divergence against a reference LLM, focusing on the evaluation of full answers generated by the models. However, the generation of these responses occurs in a token level, following a sequential, auto-regressive fashion. In this paper, we introduce Token-level Direct Preference Optimization (TDPO), a novel approach to align LLMs with human preferences by optimizing policy at the token level. Unlike previous methods, which face challenges in divergence efficiency, TDPO integrates forward KL divergence constraints for each token, improving alignment and diversity. Utilizing the Bradley-Terry model for a token-based reward system, our method enhances the regulation of KL divergence, while preserving simplicity without the need for explicit reward modeling. Experimental results across various text tasks demonstrate TDPO’s superior performance in balancing alignment with generation diversity. Notably, fine-tuning with TDPO strikes a better balance than DPO in the controlled sentiment generation and single-turn dialogue datasets, and significantly improves the quality of generated responses compared to both DPO and PPO-based RLHF methods."}
{"title": "EAGLE: Speculative Sampling Requires Rethinking Feature Uncertainty", "abstract": "Autoregressive decoding makes the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) time-consuming. In this paper, we reconsider speculative sampling and derive two key observations. Firstly, autoregression at the feature (second-to-top-layer) level is more straightforward than at the token level. Secondly, the inherent uncertainty in feature (second-to-top-layer) level autoregression constrains its performance. Based on these insights, we introduce EAGLE (Extrapolation Algorithm for Greater Language-model Efficiency), a simple yet highly efficient speculative sampling framework. By incorporating a token sequence advanced by one time step, EAGLE effectively resolves the uncertainty, enabling precise second-to-top-layer feature prediction with minimal overhead. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of EAGLE, including all models from the Vicuna and LLaMA2-Chat series, the MoE model Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, and tasks in dialogue, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and instruction following. For LLaMA2-Chat 70B, EAGLE achieved a latency speedup ratio of **2.7x-3.5x**, doubled throughput, while maintaining the distribution of the generated text."}
{"title": "PID: Prompt-Independent Data Protection Against Latent Diffusion Models", "abstract": "The few-shot fine-tuning of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) has enabled them to grasp new concepts from a limited number of images. However, given the vast amount of personal images accessible online, this capability raises critical concerns about civil privacy. While several previous defense methods have been developed to prevent such misuse of LDMs, they typically assume that the textual prompts used by data protectors exactly match those employed by data exploiters. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate that breaking this assumption, i.e., in cases where discrepancies exist between the textual conditions used by protectors and exploiters, could substantially reduces the effectiveness of these defenses. Furthermore, considering the visual encoder's independence from textual prompts, we delve into the visual encoder and thoroughly investigate how manipulating the visual encoder affects the few-shot fine-tuning process of LDMs. Drawing on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective method called Prompt-Independent Defense (PID) to safeguard privacy against LDMs. We show that PID can act as a strong privacy shield on its own while requiring significantly less computational power. We believe our studies, along with the comprehensive understanding and new defense method, provide a notable advance toward reliable data protection against LDMs."}
{"title": "MLAgentBench: Evaluating Language Agents on Machine Learning Experimentation", "abstract": "A central aspect of machine learning research is experimentation, the process of designing and running experiments, analyzing the results, and iterating towards some positive outcome (e.g., improving accuracy). Could agents driven by powerful language models perform machine learning experimentation effectively? To answer this question, we introduce MLAgentBench, a suite of 13 tasks ranging from improving model performance on CIFAR-10 to recent research problems like BabyLM. For each task, an agent can perform actions like reading/writing files, executing code, and inspecting outputs. We then construct an agent that can perform ML experimentation based on ReAct framework. We benchmark agents based on Claude v1.0, Claude v2.1, Claude v3 Opus, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, Gemini-Pro, and Mixtral and find that a Claude v3 Opus agent is the best in terms of success rate. It can build compelling ML models over many tasks in MLAgentBench with 37.5% average success rate. Our agents also display highly interpretable plans and actions. However, the success rates vary considerably; they span from 100% on well-established older datasets to as low as 0% on recent Kaggle challenges created potentially after the underlying LM was trained. Finally, we identify several key challenges for LM-based agents such as long-term planning and reducing hallucination."}

Although PEFT has demonstrated effectiveness and been widely applied, the underlying principles are still unclear. In this paper, we adopt the PAC-Bayesian generalization error bound, viewing pre-training as a shift of prior distribution which leads to a tighter bound for generalization error. We validate this shift from the perspectives of oscillations in the loss landscape and the quasi-sparsity in gradient distribution. Based on this, we propose a gradient-based sparse fine-tuning algorithm, named $\\textbf{S}$parse $\\textbf{I}$ncrement $\\textbf{F}$ine-$\\textbf{T}$uning(SIFT), and validate its effectiveness on a range of tasks including the GLUE Benchmark and Instruction-tuning.

{"title": "SqueezeLLM: Dense-and-Sparse Quantization", "abstract": "Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable results for a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models for inference has been a significant challenge due to their unprecedented resource requirements. This has forced existing deployment frameworks to use multi-GPU inference pipelines, which are often complex and costly, or to use smaller and less performant models. In this work, we demonstrate that the main bottleneck for generative inference with LLMs is memory bandwidth, rather than compute, specifically for single batch inference. While quantization has emerged as a promising solution by representing weights with reduced precision, previous efforts have often resulted in notable performance degradation. To address this, we introduce SqueezeLLM, a post-training quantization framework that not only enables lossless compression to ultra-low precisions of up to 3-bit, but also achieves higher quantization performance under the same memory constraint. Our framework incorporates two novel ideas: (i) sensitivity-based non-uniform quantization, which searches for the optimal bit precision assignment based on second-order information; and (ii) the Dense-and-Sparse decomposition that stores outliers and sensitive weight values in an efficient sparse format. When applied to the LLaMA models, our 3-bit quantization significantly reduces the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline by up to 2.1x as compared to the state-of-the-art methods with the same memory requirement. Furthermore, when deployed on an A6000 GPU, our quantized models achieve up to 2.3x speedup compared to the baseline. Our code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/SqueezeLLM."}

However, these formulas, including the popular Deepmind Chinchilla scaling laws, neglect to include the cost of inference. We modify the Chinchilla scaling laws to calculate the optimal LLM parameter count and pre-training data size to train and deploy a model of a given quality and inference demand. We conduct our analysis both in terms of a compute budget and real-world costs and find that LLM researchers expecting reasonably large inference demand ($\\sim$1B requests) should train models smaller and longer than Chinchilla-optimal. Furthermore, we train 47 models of varying sizes and parameter counts to validate our formula and find that model quality continues to improve as we scale tokens per parameter to extreme ranges (up to 10,000). Finally, we ablate the procedure used to fit the Chinchilla scaling law coefficients and find that developing scaling laws only from data collected at typical token/parameter ratios overestimates the impact of additional tokens at these extreme ranges."}

We study how to best build a *library* of adapters given multi-task data and devise techniques for both *zero-shot* and *supervised* task generalization through *routing* in such library. We benchmark existing approaches to build this library and introduce model-based clustering, $\\texttt{MBC}$, a method that groups tasks based on the similarity of their adapter parameters, indirectly optimizing for transfer across the multi-task dataset. In order to reuse the library, we present a novel zero-shot routing mechanism, $\\texttt{Arrow}$, which enables dynamic selection of the most relevant adapters for new inputs without the need for retraining. We experiment with several LLMs, such as Phi-2 and Mistral, on a wide array of held-out tasks, verifying that MBC-based adapters and Arrow routing lead to superior generalization to new tasks. Thus, we make steps towards creating modular, adaptable LLMs that can match or outperform traditional joint training."}
{"title": "Self-Rewarding Language Models", "abstract": "We posit that to achieve superhuman agents, future models require superhuman feedback in order to provide an adequate training signal. Current approaches commonly train reward models from human preferences, which may then be bottlenecked by human performance level, and secondly these reward models require additional human preferences data to further improve.In this work, we study Self-Rewarding Language Models, where the language model itself is used via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting to provide its own rewards during training. We show that during Iterative DPO training, not only does instruction following ability improve, but also the ability to provide high-quality rewards to itself. Fine-tuning Llama 2 70B on three iterations of our approach yields a model that outperforms many existing systems on the AlpacaEval 2.0 leaderboard, including Claude 2, Gemini Pro, and GPT-4 0613. While there is much left still to explore, this work opens the door to the possibility of models that can continually improve in both axes."}

We demonstrate this for several LLMs (Llama-2-7B, Llama-2-13B, Mistral-7B-v0.1) and datasets (Alpaca-52k, Evol-Instruct-70k). In addition, a lightweight refinement of such long instructions can further improve the abilities of the fine-tuned LLMs, and allows us to obtain competitive results on MT-Bench and the 2nd highest-ranked Llama-2-7B-based model on AlpacaEval 2.0, while training on only 1,000 examples and no extra preference data. We also conduct a thorough analysis of our models to ensure that their enhanced performance is not simply due to GPT-4's preference for longer responses. Overall, our findings suggest that fine-tuning on the longest responses should be the default baseline for any work on instruction fine-tuning. We provide our code in this GitHub repository."}
